The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Migrate Commons Lang from 2 to 3 and StringEscapeUtils to Commons Text\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.MigrateCommonsLang2ToLang3AndCommonText\n    Migrate Commons Lang from 2 to 3 and StringEscapeUtils to Commons Text.\n\nThis pull request upgrades Apache Commons Lang 2 to Apache Commons Lang 3. Additionally, if the plugin uses StringEscapeUtils from Apache Commons Lang, it will be migrated to use Apache Commons Text instead.\nThe Apache Commons community recommends using Apache Commons Text for string escaping operations, as it offers a more focused and feature-rich API for text processing.\nWhat's Changed?\n\nMigrated from deprecated/EOL Apache Commons Lang 2 to Commons Lang 3.\nIf applicable: Transitioned from deprecated/EOL StringEscapeUtils in Apache Commons Lang to Commons Text.",
