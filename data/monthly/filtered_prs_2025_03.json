This transition serves as an intermediary phase, ensuring that all systems are optimized for Java 11 before making the leap to Java 17.\nEnhancements and Security\nBy moving to this LTS version, we benefit from the latest performance and security improvements foundational to Java 11. Ensuring our dependencies are up-to-date and secure prepares the groundwork for a smoother transition to Java 17.\nLong-Term Support\nThe LTS version provides the necessary support and stability for Java 11, offering assurance during our gradual migration process. This allows us to take advantage of long-term updates and critical patches.\nEmbracing these incremental changes aligns our development environment with current standards and strategically positions us for future advancement. We appreciate your feedback and testing as we aim for a seamless adjustment period.",

    "description": "Use Java 17 language features\nUse Java 17 pattern matching instanceof.  Makes the code easier to read by avoding the cast that often follows an instanceof.\nUse Java 17 string formatting.  Slight simplification of the code through OpenRewrite.\nUse Java 17 @serial annotation.  Annotation that may allow future checks for serialization.  No real benefit today as far as I can tell.\nSpecial thanks to OpenRewrite for https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/upgradetojava17\nTesting done\nConfirmed that automated tests pass.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
