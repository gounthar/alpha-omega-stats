While it would be possible to provide that on-demand capability, I personally do not see the reason for it and would argue that it somewhat defeats the purpose of a Rule/Extension.\nTo allow the container to be used per test (like a Rule) as well as per class (like a ClassRule), the Extension can be registered either as a static or an instance variable.\nTesting done\nAdded tests to cover the different variants (static vs. instance registration) of the extension. I also did some manual testing for things that can not really be covered by unit tests.\nCopied existing tests for DockerContainer implementations to verify these work with JUnit 5.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

Still there are some tests that I could not run in environement.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nMigrate tests to JUnit5\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label internal, tests\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nAnyone really, it's a big changeset with lots of repetitions.\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

However I failed to come up with a better solution that does not force me to refactor the entire thing. Something that would already help is to allow the classes to be compared more easily. Right now the formatting is all over the place - spotless could help.\nOverall there is some very questionable coding, hacks and workarounds in both implementations, existing and new. I already removed some deprecations as well as TODO that are no longer relevant. Another pair of eyes would however help here.\nAs always, give me a ping if there any questions.\nTesting done\nI copied the existing tests for the rules above and adapted them to use JUnit5 and my *Extension implementations.\nMy main concern right now is that even the existing tests are only covering a small percentage of the functionallity provided, meaning there is a certain risk that some things simply do not work (yet).\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

The reasons vary per class, overall it's mostly either some custom JenkinsRule implementations that as of now do not properly work with JUnit5.

Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nAnyone really, it's a giant changeset with lots of repetitions.\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

When we changed Response.trailers() to block instead of\nthrowing in 5.0.0, we inadvertently removed the ability for callers to peek the trailers\n(by catching the IllegalStateException if they weren't available). This new API restores that\ncapability.\n\n\nFix: Don't crash on trailers() if the response doesn't have a body. We broke [Retrofit] users\nwho read the trailers on the raw() OkHttp response, after its body was decoded.\n\n\nVersion 5.0.0\n2025-07-02\nThis is our first stable release of OkHttp since 2023. Here's the highlights if you're upgrading\nfrom OkHttp 4.x:\nOkHttp is now packaged as separate JVM and Android artifacts. This allows us to offer\nplatform-specific features and optimizations. If your build system handles [Gradle module metadata],\nthis change should be automatic.\nMockWebServer has a new coordinate and package name. We didn’t like that our old artifact\ndepends on JUnit 4 so the new one doesn’t. It also has a better API built on immutable values. (We\nintend to continue publishing the old okhttp3.mockwebserver artifact so there’s no urgency to\nmigrate.)\n\n\n\nCoordinate\nPackage Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3\nCore module. No JUnit dependency!\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit4:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3.junit4\nOptional JUnit 4 integration.\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit5:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3.junit5\nOptional JUnit 5 integration.\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:5.0.0\nokhttp3.mockwebserver\nObsolete. Depends on JUnit 4.\n\n\n\nOkHttp now supports Happy Eyeballs ([RFC 8305][rfc_8305]) for IPv4+IPv6 networks. It attempts\nboth IPv6 and IPv4 connections concurrently, keeping whichever connects first.\nWe’ve improved our Kotlin APIs.

When we changed Response.trailers() to block instead of\nthrowing in 5.0.0, we inadvertently removed the ability for callers to peek the trailers\n(by catching the IllegalStateException if they weren't available). This new API restores that\ncapability.\n\n\nFix: Don't crash on trailers() if the response doesn't have a body. We broke [Retrofit] users\nwho read the trailers on the raw() OkHttp response, after its body was decoded.\n\n\nVersion 5.0.0\n2025-07-02\nThis is our first stable release of OkHttp since 2023. Here's the highlights if you're upgrading\nfrom OkHttp 4.x:\nOkHttp is now packaged as separate JVM and Android artifacts. This allows us to offer\nplatform-specific features and optimizations. If your build system handles [Gradle module metadata],\nthis change should be automatic.\nMockWebServer has a new coordinate and package name. We didn’t like that our old artifact\ndepends on JUnit 4 so the new one doesn’t. It also has a better API built on immutable values. (We\nintend to continue publishing the old okhttp3.mockwebserver artifact so there’s no urgency to\nmigrate.)\n\n\n\nCoordinate\nPackage Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3\nCore module. No JUnit dependency!\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit4:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3.junit4\nOptional JUnit 4 integration.\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver3-junit5:5.0.0\nmockwebserver3.junit5\nOptional JUnit 5 integration.\n\n\ncom.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:5.0.0\nokhttp3.mockwebserver\nObsolete. Depends on JUnit 4.\n\n\n\nOkHttp now supports Happy Eyeballs ([RFC 8305][rfc_8305]) for IPv4+IPv6 networks. It attempts\nboth IPv6 and IPv4 connections concurrently, keeping whichever connects first.\nWe’ve improved our Kotlin APIs. You can skip the builder:\nval request = Request(\n  url = \"https://cash.app/\".toHttpUrl(),\n)\nOkHttp now supports [GraalVM].\nHere’s what has changed since 5.0.0-alpha.17:\n\n\n... (truncated)\n\n\nCommits\n\nd2dd180 Prepare for release 5.1.0.\n61a8735 New Response.peekTrailers() API (#8921)\n6684401 Update dependency gradle to v8.14.3 (#8915)\n7adb2b6 Update junit-framework monorepo (#8914)\ne41ff18 Link to new mockwebserver artifacts (#8911)\n0ff8751 Remove Graal init tracing (#8909)\nb9a2560 Run graal on master (#8907)\n8339524 Remove ExperimentalOkHttpApi references (#8908)\nce29ef6 Fix graal tests (#8906)\n8579689 Don't force a response body read on all trailers (#8904)\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Read user documentation for the list of supported version.\nCasC for Data Center endpoint removes some unused fields: callCanMerge and callChanges. They should be remove from your YAML, a warning is logged. Specific CasC configurator to handle missing fields will be removed in future releases.\nevents (pr:reviewer:approved, pr:reviewer:updated and pr....) are not listen anymore, these kind of events do not ship any changes related the source code to justify a new build. For this reason by default has been disabled reindex of the whole Organisation or multibranch for events that does not ship any changes. See JENKINS-55927 and its related PR for a complete discussion.\nThe introduction of extension points to customise webhooks (now in beta) deprecates some methods in api interfaces.

The way to do this way sleeker in my opinion is to make use of AutoClosable like so:\n@Test\nvoid myTestCase() {\n  // do stuff that is required for my test...\n  try (LogRecorder recorder = new LogRecorder().record(\"Foo\", Level.INFO).capture(100)) {\n    // do the stuff I want to record...\n    assertThat(recorder, LogRecorder.recorded(equalTo(\"MyMessage\")));\n  }\n}\nSee LogRecorderTest for more examples of this.\nUltimately this new utility enables more tests to migrate away from JUnit4.\nTesting done\nClean build with mvn clean verify\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
