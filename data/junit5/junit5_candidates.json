      "body": "Fixes #901\nThis PR raises the default permissions of JUnit5JenkinsRule to align with their JUnit4 counterparts.\nIt is important to notice that this change is breaking and will cause some JUnit5 based plugin tests to fail in case they rely on the fact that the default user / permission is Unauthenticated.\nThe alternative would be to leave the permissions as they are but make users aware of the differences in JUnit4 and JUnit5.\nMigration\nJUnit5 based tests may fail due to this change (as they expect to run in an Unauthenticated context) - like for example:\n@Test\nvoid testUnauthenticated(JenkinsRule r) throws Exception {\n    DummySecurityRealm realm = r.createDummySecurityRealm();\n    r.jenkins.setSecurityRealm(realm);\n\n    MockAuthorizationStrategy strategy = new MockAuthorizationStrategy();\n    r.jenkins.setAuthorizationStrategy(strategy);\n\n    assertThrows(AccessDeniedException.class, () -\u003e somethingUnauthenticatedUsersCanNotDo());\n}\nTo restore the previous behavior tests need to explicitly impersonate an ANONYMOUS user like so:\n@Test\nvoid testUnauthenticated(JenkinsRule r) throws Exception {\n    DummySecurityRealm realm = r.createDummySecurityRealm();\n    r.jenkins.setSecurityRealm(realm);\n\n    MockAuthorizationStrategy strategy = new MockAuthorizationStrategy();\n    r.jenkins.setAuthorizationStrategy(strategy);\n\n    try (ACLContext ignored = ACL.as2(Jenkins.ANONYMOUS2)) {\n        assertThrows(AccessDeniedException.class, () -\u003e somethingUnauthenticatedUsersCanNotDo());\n    }\n}\nTesting done\nAdded org.jvnet.hudson.test.JenkinsRulePermissionTest to validate the behavior.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

The way to do this way sleeker in my opinion is to make use of AutoClosable like so:\n@Test\nvoid myTestCase() {\n  // do stuff that is required for my test...\n  try (LogRecorder recorder = new LogRecorder().record(\"Foo\", Level.INFO).capture(100)) {\n    // do the stuff I want to record...\n    assertThat(recorder, LogRecorder.recorded(equalTo(\"MyMessage\")));\n  }\n}\nSee LogRecorderTest for more examples of this.\nUltimately this new utility enables more tests to migrate away from JUnit4.\nTesting done\nClean build with mvn clean verify\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
