The reasons vary per class, overall it's mostly either some custom JenkinsRule implementations that as of now do not properly work with JUnit5. There are also cases where a migration would simply require too much effort with too much risk of altering a tests intentions.\n\nList of test classes not migrated to JUnit5\n\nAbstractItem2Test\nAgentInboundUrlTest\nApiTokenStatsRestartTest\nArgumentListBuilder2Test\nBasicHeaderApiTokenAuthenticatorTest\nBindTest\nBootFailureTest\nBuiltInNodeMigrationRestartTest\nClassicPluginStrategyTest\nCustomClassFilterTest\nCustomPluginManagerTest\nDisablePluginCommandTest\nDoubleLaunchCheckerTest\nErrorPageTest\nExtensionListListenerTest\nExtensionListRjrTest\nFileParameterValuePersistenceTest\nHudsonPrivateSecurityRealmFIPSTest\nInboundAgentTlsTest\nJNLPLauncherRealTest\nJenkins64991Test\nJenkinsBuildsAndWorkspacesDirectoriesTest\nJenkinsLocationConfigurationTest\nJenkinsLogRecordsTest\nJenkinsManagePermissionTest\nJenkinsSupportAnnotationsTest\nJenkinsTest\nJnlpAccessWithSecuredHudsonTest\nJnlpProtocol4ProxyHandlerTest\nJnlpSlaveRestarterInstallerTest\nLifecycleTest\nLoadDetachedPluginsTest\nLoginTest\nNameRefTest\nNodeParallelTest\nNodeProvisionerTest\nNodesRestartTest\nOfflineNodeCommandTest\nOldRemotingAgentTest\nPluginManagerInstalledGUITest\nPluginManagerTest\nProjectTest\nProxyConfigurationManagerGUITest\nQueueCrashTest\nQueueRestartTest\nResponseTimeMonitorTest\nReverseBuildTriggerAfterRestartTest\nReverseProxySetupMonitorTest\nRunActionTest\nSecurity218Test\nSecurity3430Test\nSecurity3501Test\nSecurity637Test\nSecurityContextExecutorServiceTest\nSetContextClassLoaderTest\nSetupWizardRestartTest\nSymbolJenkinsTest\nUnsupportedRemotingAgentEscapeHatchTest\nUnsupportedRemotingAgentTest\nUpdateCenterCustomTest\nUpdateCenterMigrationTest\nUserRestartTest\nUserSeedPropertyRestartTest\nWebSocketAgentsTest\nXStream2AnnotationTest\n\n\nI am well aware that this is a huge changeset however I hope that there is still interest in this PR and it will be reviewed.\nIf there are any questions, please do not hesitate to ping me.\nTesting done\nLot's of local testing. Still there are some tests that do not run in my environement (with or without any changes).\nProposed changelog entries\n\nMigrate tests to JUnit5\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label internal, tests\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nAnyone really, it's a giant changeset with lots of repetitions.\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nAnyone really, it's a giant changeset with lots of repetitions.\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

The way to do this way sleeker in my opinion is to make use of AutoClosable like so:\n@Test\nvoid myTestCase() {\n  // do stuff that is required for my test...\n  try (LogRecorder recorder = new LogRecorder().record(\"Foo\", Level.INFO).capture(100)) {\n    // do the stuff I want to record...\n    assertThat(recorder, LogRecorder.recorded(equalTo(\"MyMessage\")));\n  }\n}\nSee LogRecorderTest for more examples of this.\nUltimately this new utility enables more tests to migrate away from JUnit4.\nTesting done\nClean build with mvn clean verify\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
