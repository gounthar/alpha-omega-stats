# Development Context & Progress Tracking

This file tracks the current development context, implementation plans, and progress for the GitHub Profile Tools project.

## Current Feature: Advanced Caching System

**Branch**: `feature/advanced-caching-system`
**Started**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: In Progress

### Problem Statement
The current implementation makes fresh API calls for every profile analysis, leading to:
- Slow performance for repeated analysis
- Excessive GitHub API quota consumption
- Poor user experience when generating multiple templates
- No resilience against temporary API failures

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic File-Based Caching âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement persistent caching to avoid redundant API calls
**Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

**Components to implement**:
1. **Cache Storage Layer**
   - File-based JSON cache in `./data/cache/`
   - Cache key generation based on username + analysis scope
   - Thread-safe cache operations

2. **Cache Manager**
   - Cache hit/miss detection
   - TTL (Time-To-Live) management with configurable expiration
   - Cache cleanup and maintenance

3. **Integration Points**
   - Modify `analyzer.go` to check cache before API calls
   - Update CLI to support cache control flags
   - Add cache statistics and reporting

**New CLI Options**:
- `--force-refresh` - Bypass cache and force fresh API calls
- `--cache-ttl duration` - Set custom cache expiration (default: 24h)
- `--cache-dir path` - Custom cache directory location
- `--cache-stats` - Show cache hit/miss statistics

#### Phase 2: Cache Architecture Improvements ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PRIORITY
**Goal**: Address technical debt and optimization opportunities identified in code review

**Critical Tasks (Before Production Deployment)**:
1. **Unit Tests for Cache Layer** ðŸš¨ **BLOCKER**
   - Test concurrent access scenarios (race conditions we fixed)
   - Test cache expiration and cleanup logic
   - Test error conditions and fallback behavior
   - Test marshal/unmarshal edge cases and corruption scenarios
   - **Priority**: Critical (required for production readiness per CodeRabbit review)

**High-Priority Refactoring Tasks**:
2. **Decouple Key Format Dependencies**
   - Replace string prefix matching in `getFilePath()` with explicit key type passing
   - Modify storage layer to accept `CacheKey` struct with type information
   - Eliminate fragile coupling between storage and key generation logic
   - **Priority**: High (affects maintainability and reliability)

3. **Optimize Cache Deserialization**
   - Extract generic helper function to reduce code duplication in cache retrieval
   - Implement `rehydrate[T any]()` function for type-safe cache data conversion
   - Reduce marshal/unmarshal overhead with more efficient deserialization
   - **Priority**: Medium (affects performance and code quality)

**Future Enhancements**:
4. **Enhanced Cache Architecture**
   - Consider codec interface to eliminate double serialization entirely
   - Implement typed cache storage to handle struct types natively
   - Add cache versioning for backward compatibility during upgrades
   - **Priority**: Low (future optimization)

#### Phase 3: Smart Incremental Updates
**Goal**: Update only changed data instead of full re-analysis

**Components**:
1. **Incremental Data Fetching**
   - Track last analysis timestamp
   - Fetch only new commits, repositories, contributions since last run
   - Merge incremental data with cached baseline

2. **Selective Cache Invalidation**
   - Invalidate specific cache segments (repos, contributions, organizations)
   - Smart refresh based on detected changes
   - Background refresh capabilities

#### Phase 4: Advanced Cache Features
**Goal**: Production-ready caching with enterprise features

**Components**:
1. **Cache Optimization**
   - Compression for large profiles
   - Cache size limits and LRU eviction
   - Cache warming strategies

2. **Distributed Caching** (Future)
   - Redis support for team environments
   - Shared cache across multiple instances
   - Cache synchronization
