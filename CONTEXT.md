# Development Context & Progress Tracking

This file tracks the current development context, implementation plans, and progress for the GitHub Profile Tools project.

## Current Feature: Advanced Caching System

**Branch**: `feature/advanced-caching-system`
**Started**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: In Progress

### Problem Statement
The current implementation makes fresh API calls for every profile analysis, leading to:
- Slow performance for repeated analysis
- Excessive GitHub API quota consumption
- Poor user experience when generating multiple templates
- No resilience against temporary API failures

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic File-Based Caching ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement persistent caching to avoid redundant API calls
**Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

**Components to implement**:
1. **Cache Storage Layer**
   - File-based JSON cache in `./data/cache/`
   - Cache key generation based on username + analysis scope
   - Thread-safe cache operations

2. **Cache Manager**
   - Cache hit/miss detection
   - TTL (Time-To-Live) management with configurable expiration
   - Cache cleanup and maintenance

3. **Integration Points**
   - Modify `analyzer.go` to check cache before API calls
   - Update CLI to support cache control flags
   - Add cache statistics and reporting

**New CLI Options**:
- `--force-refresh` - Bypass cache and force fresh API calls
- `--cache-ttl duration` - Set custom cache expiration (default: 24h)
- `--cache-dir path` - Custom cache directory location
- `--cache-stats` - Show cache hit/miss statistics

#### Phase 2: Smart Incremental Updates
**Goal**: Update only changed data instead of full re-analysis

**Components**:
1. **Incremental Data Fetching**
   - Track last analysis timestamp
   - Fetch only new commits, repositories, contributions since last run
   - Merge incremental data with cached baseline

2. **Selective Cache Invalidation**
   - Invalidate specific cache segments (repos, contributions, organizations)
   - Smart refresh based on detected changes
   - Background refresh capabilities

#### Phase 3: Advanced Cache Features
**Goal**: Production-ready caching with enterprise features

**Components**:
1. **Cache Optimization**
   - Compression for large profiles
   - Cache size limits and LRU eviction
   - Cache warming strategies

2. **Distributed Caching** (Future)
   - Redis support for team environments
   - Shared cache across multiple instances
   - Cache synchronization

### Implementation Checklist ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE

#### Core Caching Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `internal/cache` package with basic types
- ✅ Implement `CacheManager` with file-based storage
- ✅ Add TTL support with configurable expiration
- ✅ Thread-safe cache operations with proper locking

#### Profile Analyzer Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created cache-aware analyzer wrapper
- ✅ Implement cache key generation strategy
- ✅ Add cache hit/miss logic for each analysis step
- ✅ Preserve existing progress saving functionality

#### CLI Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Add `--force-refresh` flag to bypass cache
- ✅ Add `--cache-ttl` for custom expiration times
- ✅ Add `--cache-dir` for custom cache location
- ✅ Add `--cache-stats` for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Add `--clear-cache` for cache maintenance

#### Testing & Validation ✅ BASIC TESTING COMPLETE
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ Cache stats functionality verified
- ✅ Cache clearing functionality verified
- ✅ CLI help documentation updated
- [ ] Unit tests for cache manager (future enhancement)
- [ ] Integration tests with real GitHub data (future enhancement)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (future enhancement)

#### Documentation ✅ BASIC DOCS COMPLETE
- ✅ Updated CLI help with caching examples
- ✅ Added comprehensive cache configuration options
- [ ] Update README.md with caching features (future enhancement)

### Expected Benefits

**Performance Improvements**:
- Template regeneration: ~95% faster (no API calls needed)
- Repeated analysis: ~80% faster (partial cache hits)
- Batch processing: Significant speedup for team analysis

**Resource Efficiency**:
- Reduced GitHub API quota usage by ~70-90%
- Lower network bandwidth consumption
- Better rate limit compliance

**User Experience**:
- Near-instant template switching
- Reliable operation during API outages
- Better feedback with cache statistics

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Stale cached data
**Mitigation**: Configurable TTL, force-refresh option, smart invalidation

**Risk**: Cache corruption
**Mitigation**: Checksums, graceful fallback to API, cache repair utilities

**Risk**: Disk space consumption
**Mitigation**: Cache size limits, cleanup utilities, compression

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Basic caching infrastructure implemented and functional
- ✅ CLI integration complete with all cache management flags
- ✅ Cache statistics and maintenance functionality working
- ✅ Application builds and runs without errors
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated operations (to be measured in real usage)
- [ ] Template generation time < 2 seconds for cached profiles (to be measured)
- [ ] API call reduction > 70% in typical usage scenarios (to be measured)
- [ ] Zero cache-related data corruption incidents (ongoing monitoring)
