The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the latest recommended core version and ensure the BOM matches the core version\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeToRecommendCoreVersion\n    Upgrade to the latest recommended core version and ensure the BOM matches the core version.\n\nWhy is this important?\nJenkins plugins declare a minimum supported Jenkins version.\nThe minimum Jenkins version is a useful way for plugin developers to indicate the range of Jenkins versions they are willing to support and test.\nSee the developer documentation to learn more about the recommended minimum Jenkins version.\nThe current minimum required Jenkins version is 2.462.3, which is why this pull request has been made.\nIf the plugin is already using the plugin bill of materials, then the bill of materials also needs to be updated with the matching artifactId for the minimum required Jenkins version.\nI can't see any change to the Jenkins version, how come?\nThis means your plugin POM was already using the 2.462.3 version but still required a few adjustments.\nThe checks fail, why?\nFor security reasons, the Jenkins infrastructure does not execute Jenkinsfiles proposed in pull requests.\nInstead, it builds the code using the Jenkinsfile from the default branch.\nIn this case, the existing Jenkinsfile specifies Java 8, not Java 11, which is causing the check to fail.\nTo resolve this,\na maintainer can replay the failed build\nby substituting the current Jenkinsfile content with our proposed changes using the \"replay the build\"\nfeature in Jenkins.\nPlease let us know if you need any assistance with this process.\nThanks for taking the time to review this PR.\n🙏",

The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels.

This makes the code more readable and precisely identifies which operation might fail.\nThe correct type was identified by consulting the Jenkins API documentation at:\nhttps://javadoc.jenkins.io/plugin/workflow-api/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/flow/FlowExecution.html\nwhich shows that method getOwner() returns a FlowExecutionOwner type",

    "description": "Views on the dashboard are selectable at the top of the dashboard in the Views Tab Bar\n\nAn extension point exists that allows to change the way this tab bar is presented. While most plugins that implement that extension point are quite old I recently adopted one such plugin (favorite-view) and made it work with current Jenkins.\nWhich tabbar is used is configured on the system page or on the folder page. Currently what is configured there is the truth and users don't have the possibility to adjust it to their needs.\nA similar extension point exists that allows to configure the Tab bar on the users My Views page but there is no plugin that implements the extension point (MyViewsTabBar class)\nThis change proposes the following:\n\ndeprecate the MyViewsTabBar class (and it's default implementation)\nIntroduce a new user property that makes it possible for a user to override what is configured for the global dashboard or a folder as Views Tab Bar\nInstead of the MyViewsTabBar, a user can select one of the implementations of ViewsTabBar to be used for the My Views dashboard\nthe default view on the My Views configuration is filled with a select instead of checking if the user enters a valid view name.\n\nThere a few plugins that should be adjusted once they consume a Jenkins core version with this change as they refer to the myViewsTabBar (only in jelly/groovy files)\n\ndynamic-search-view\ncategorized-view\nsectioned-view\ndelivery-pipeline\ndashboard-view\nremote-jobs-view (never published)\n\nUses ViewsTabBar in Java code\n\nnested-view\n\nWith that change org folder and multi branch jobs would also get the user specific views tab bar. So the views there would need a dedicated main.jelly to stick to the Default tab bar I think.\nAll plugins are still working but might not show the viewstabbar that a user has selected\n\nSee JENKINS-XXXXX.\n\nTesting done\nSo far interactive testing only\n\ncreate several views on the main dashboard\nconfigure an alternative ViewsTabBar (favorite-view under Manage -\u003e System\nUnder User preferences select (Inherit from Container)\nThe main dashboard uses the favorite-view tabbar\nUnder User preferences select (Default Views Tabbar)\nThe main dashboard uses the default\ncreate a second user without configuring anything in the user preferences\ndashboard shows favorite-view tabbar\n\n\nProposed changelog entries\n\nAllow to configure the views tab bar per user\n\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label rfe,web-ui\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\n\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

    "description": "Hello m2release developers! 👋\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

    "description": "Drop the 2.462.x line\nThe transition to the 2.479.x line is progressing very well.  That is causing the 2.462.x line to become an independent, outdated copy of bom-weekly.\nThere are 1800 lines in bom-weekly and 1500 lines in bom-2.462.x.  New releases of the bom-2.462.x line will have far fewer plugin updates than is typical for the oldest line in the bom.\nRemoving the 2.462.x line may also allow us to successfully complete a full build on ci.jenkins.io.  That is a temporary condition, but it will allow us more time to identify the issues on ci.jenkins.io and resolve them.\nTesting done\nConfirmed that example in contributing file passes:\nPLUGINS=structs,mailer TEST=InjectedTest bash local-test.sh\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Bumps org.jsoup:jsoup from 1.18.3 to 1.19.1.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's releases.\n\njsoup 1.19.1\nChanges\n\nAdded support for http/2 requests in Jsoup.connect(), when running on Java 11+, via the Java HttpClient\nimplementation. #2257.\n\nIn this version of jsoup, the default is to make requests via the HttpUrlConnection implementation: use\nSystem.setProperty(\"jsoup.useHttpClient\", \"true\"); to enable making requests via the HttpClient instead ,\nwhich will enable http/2 support, if available. This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels.

For example, \u003cfoo\u003cbar\u003e becomes \u003cfoo_bar\u003e, as XML does not allow \u003c in element names, but HTML5\ndoes. #2276\nReimplemented the HTML5 Adoption Agency Algorithm to the current spec. This handles mis-nested formating / structural elements. #2278\n\n\n\n... (truncated)\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.19.1 (2025-03-04)\nChanges\n\nAdded support for http/2 requests in Jsoup.connect(), when running on Java 11+, via the Java HttpClient\nimplementation. #2257.\n\nIn this version of jsoup, the default is to make requests via the HttpUrlConnection implementation: use\nSystem.setProperty(\"jsoup.useHttpClient\", \"true\"); to enable making requests via the HttpClient instead ,\nwhich will enable http/2 support, if available. This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels.

The security scanner issues warnings for the doFillCredentialsIdItems methods which are used to fill the credential list in the UI.\nI don't expect the code being called to have any side-effect, but I see the community has adopted a mixed-posture for very similar code, oscillating between ignoring the security warning, or switching to POST. Better safe than sorry: requiring a POST is unlikely to cause any problem, let's just do it even if it's not necessary.",

This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21.

When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements.

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time.

Thanks to Gürgün Dayıoğlu (@​gurgunday)!\nChanged: All the [formatting rules that were deprecated in ESLint 8.53.0][deprecated-8.53.0] are now excluded if you set the ESLINT_CONFIG_PRETTIER_NO_DEPRECATED environment variable.\n\nVersion 9.0.0 (2023-08-05)\n\nAdded: The CLI helper tool now works with eslint.config.js (flat config). Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the [ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the config of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) – it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.\nChanged: [unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add \"unicode-bom\": \"off\" to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with --fix to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM). Thanks to Nicolas Stepien (@​nstepien)!\n\nVersion 8.10.0 (2023-08-03)\n\nAdded: [max-statements-per-line]. Thanks to @​Zamiell!\n\nVersion 8.9.0 (2023-07-27)\n\nAdded: [vue/array-element-newline].

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n• In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n• Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

    "description": "Hello jms-messaging developers! 👋\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n• In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n• Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

This will address Issue #375 by permitting authentication with a region that is opted-in in the source AWS account, while accessing ECS clusters in an opt-in region in the target account (which is not opted-in for the source account).\nThe solution was adding an authRegion list-box to choose the region used for IAM authentication, which is stored in an authRegion variable.

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n• In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n• Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n• In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n• Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

    "description": "Hello favorite-view developers! 👋\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

    "description": "Hello bitbucket-oauth developers! 👋\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",
