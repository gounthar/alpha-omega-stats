Previously, if you did something like this:\ngson.fromJson(jsonString, new TypeToken\u003cImmutableList\u003cString\u003e\u003e() {})\n\nthen the inferred type would be ImmutableList\u003cString\u003e, but Gson actually gave you an ArrayList\u003cString\u003e. Usually that would lead to an immediate ClassCastException, but in some circumstances the code might sometimes succeed despite the wrong type. Now you will see an exception like this:\ncom.google.gson.JsonIOException: Abstract classes can't be instantiated!\nAdjust the R8 configuration or register an InstanceCreator or a TypeAdapter for this type.\nClass name: com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList\n\nbecause Gson now really is trying to create an ImmutableList through its constructor, but that isn't possible.\nEither change the requested type (in the TypeToken) to List\u003cString\u003e, or register a TypeAdapter or JsonDeserializer for ImmutableList.\n\n\nThe internal classes $Gson$Types and $Gson$Preconditions have been renamed to remove the $ characters. Since these are internal classes (as signaled not only by the package name but by the $ characters), client code should not be affected. If your code was depending on these classes then we suggest making a copy of the class (subject to the license) rather than depending on the new names.\n\n\nFull Changelog: google/gson@gson-parent-2.12.1...gson-parent-2.13.0\nGson 2.12.1\nThe only difference between this release and 2.12.0 is that OSGi declarations in the Gson jar now specify that com.google.errorprone.annotations  is an optional dependency, not a required one.

    "description": "#1657 introduced a fragile workaround in FormValidationTest (moving from jenkins.open() to clicking on a breadcrumb link), and that fragile workaround was copied and pasted in more places in #1749. That code was then adjusted even further in #1917, which is still causing some problems for OEMs that have not adopted the Jenkins header change. This PR does some code cleanup:\n\nRestores FormValidationTest to the less fragile way it was before #1657, effectively reimplementing #1657 to use BiDi to dismiss the alert. This removes the fragility associated with #jenkins-head-icon.\nAdds this new BiDi implementation to CspRule, avoiding the need for copypasta in a bunch of tests and saving test execution time when CspRule is disabled.\n\nThe net result is a strict improvement over the status quo: less copypasta and less fragility because the codebase now has no references to #jenkins-head-icon.\nThere is likely still more cleanup that can be done; for example, \n  \n    \n      acceptance-test-harness/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/test/acceptance/FallbackConfig.java\n    \n    \n        Lines 364 to 372\n      in\n      40f6a58\n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n        \n          \n           // https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/1151 \n        \n\n        \n          \n           // https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1264259 \n        \n\n        \n          \n           // https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434872 \n        \n\n        \n          \n           d.navigate().to(\"about:mozilla\"); \n        \n\n        \n          \n           Alert alert = ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent().apply(d); \n        \n\n        \n          \n           if (alert != null) { \n        \n\n        \n          \n               alert.accept(); \n        \n\n        \n          \n               d.navigate().refresh(); \n        \n\n        \n          \n           } \n        \n    \n  \n\n still looks suspicious, and the sleep statement in FormValidationTest (which has been there for many, many years) is probably suspicious as well.

The specific HTML produced by the pretty-printer may be different from previous versions. #2286.\nAdded the ability to define custom tags, and to modify properties of known tags, via the TagSet tag collection. Their properties can impact both the parse and how content is serialized (output as HTML or XML). #2285.\nElement.cssSelector() will prefer to return shorter selectors by using ancestor IDs when available and unique. E.g. #id \u003e div \u003e p instead of  html \u003e body \u003e div \u003e div \u003e p #2283.\nAdded Elements.deselect(int index), Elements.deselect(Object o), and Elements.deselectAll() methods to remove elements from the Elements list without removing them from the underlying DOM. Also added Elements.asList() method to get a modifiable list of elements without affecting the DOM. (Individual Elements remain linked to the DOM.) #2100.\nAdded support for sending a request body from an InputStream with Connection.requestBodyStream(InputStream stream). #1122.\nThe XML parser now supports scoped xmlns: prefix namespace declarations, and applies the correct namespace to Tags and Attributes. Also, added Tag#prefix(), Tag#localName(), Attribute#prefix(), Attribute#localName(), and Attribute#namespace() to retrieve these. #2299.\nCSS identifiers are now escaped and unescaped correctly to the CSS spec. Element#cssSelector() will emit appropriately escaped selectors, and the QueryParser supports those. Added Selector.escapeCssIdentifier() and ` Selector.unescapeCssIdentifier(). #2297, #2305\n\nStructure and Performance Improvements\n\nRefactored the CSS QueryParser into a clearer recursive descent parser. #2310.\nCSS selectors with consecutive combinators (e.g. div \u003e\u003e p) will throw an explicit parse exception. #2311.\nPerformance: reduced the shallow size of an Element from 40 to 32 bytes, and the NodeList from 32 to 24. #2307.\nPerformance: reduced GC load of new StringBuilders when tokenizing input HTML. #2304.\nMade Parser instances threadsafe, so that inadvertent use of the same instance across threads will not lead to errors. For actual concurrency, use Parser#newInstance() per thread. #2314.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nElement names containing characters invalid in XML are now normalized to valid XML names when serializing. #1496.\nWhen serializing to XML, characters that are invalid in XML 1.0 should be removed (not encoded). #1743.\nWhen converting a Document to the W3C DOM in W3CDom, elements with an attribute in an undeclared namespace now get a declaration of xmlns:prefix=\"undefined\". This allows subsequent serialization to XML via W3CDom.asString() to succeed. #2087.\nThe StreamParser could emit the final elements of a document twice, due to how onNodeCompleted was fired when closing out the stack. #2295.\nWhen parsing with the XML parser and error tracking enabled, the trailing ? in \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e would incorrectly emit an error. #2298.\nCalling Element#cssSelector() on an element with combining characters in the class or ID now produces the correct output. #1984.\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.20.1 (2025-04-29)\nChanges\n\nTo better follow the HTML5 spec and current browsers, the HTML parser no longer allows self-closing tags (\u003cfoo /\u003e)\nto close HTML elements by default.

Element#cssSelector() will emit\nappropriately escaped selectors, and the QueryParser supports those. Added Selector.escapeCssIdentifier() and `\nSelector.unescapeCssIdentifier(). #‚Äã2297, #‚Äã2305\n\nStructure and Performance Improvements\n\nRefactored the CSS QueryParser into a clearer recursive descent\nparser. #‚Äã2310.\nCSS selectors with consecutive combinators (e.g. div \u003e\u003e p) will throw an explicit parse\nexception. #‚Äã2311.\nPerformance: reduced the shallow size of an Element from 40 to 32 bytes, and the NodeList from 32 to 24.\n#‚Äã2307.\nPerformance: reduced GC load of new StringBuilders when tokenizing input\nHTML. #‚Äã2304.\nMade Parser instances threadsafe, so that inadvertent use of the same instance across threads will not lead to\nerrors. For actual concurrency, use Parser#newInstance() per\nthread. #‚Äã2314.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nElement names containing characters invalid in XML are now normalized to valid XML names when\nserializing. #‚Äã1496.\nWhen serializing to XML, characters that are invalid in XML 1.0 should be removed (not\nencoded). #‚Äã1743.\nWhen converting a Document to the W3C DOM in W3CDom, elements with an attribute in an undeclared namespace now\nget a declaration of xmlns:prefix=\"undefined\". This allows subsequent serialization to XML via W3CDom.asString()\nto succeed. #‚Äã2087.\nThe StreamParser could emit the final elements of a document twice, due to how onNodeCompleted was fired when closing out the stack. #‚Äã2295.\nWhen parsing with the XML parser and error tracking enabled, the trailing ? in \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e would\nincorrectly emit an error. #‚Äã2298.\nCalling Element#cssSelector() on an element with combining characters in the class or ID now produces the correct output. #‚Äã1984.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nüìÖ Schedule: Branch creation - Between 12:00 AM and 03:59 AM ( * 0-3 * * * ) (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\nüö¶ Automerge: Disabled by config.

Foreign content (SVG, MathML), and content parsed with the XML parser, still supports self-closing tags. If you need specific HTML tags to support self-closing, you can register a custom tag via\nthe TagSet configured in Parser.tagSet(), using Tag#set(Tag.SelfClose). Standard void tags (such as \u003cimg\u003e, \u003cbr\u003e, etc.) continue to behave as usual and are not affected by this\nchange. #2300.\nThe following internal components have been deprecated.

The specific HTML produced by the pretty-printer may be different from previous versions. #2286.\nAdded the ability to define custom tags, and to modify properties of known tags, via the TagSet tag collection. Their properties can impact both the parse and how content is serialized (output as HTML or XML). #2285.\nElement.cssSelector() will prefer to return shorter selectors by using ancestor IDs when available and unique. E.g. #id \u003e div \u003e p instead of  html \u003e body \u003e div \u003e div \u003e p #2283.\nAdded Elements.deselect(int index), Elements.deselect(Object o), and Elements.deselectAll() methods to remove elements from the Elements list without removing them from the underlying DOM. Also added Elements.asList() method to get a modifiable list of elements without affecting the DOM. (Individual Elements remain linked to the DOM.) #2100.\nAdded support for sending a request body from an InputStream with Connection.requestBodyStream(InputStream stream). #1122.\nThe XML parser now supports scoped xmlns: prefix namespace declarations, and applies the correct namespace to Tags and Attributes. Also, added Tag#prefix(), Tag#localName(), Attribute#prefix(), Attribute#localName(), and Attribute#namespace() to retrieve these. #2299.\nCSS identifiers are now escaped and unescaped correctly to the CSS spec. Element#cssSelector() will emit appropriately escaped selectors, and the QueryParser supports those. Added Selector.escapeCssIdentifier() and ` Selector.unescapeCssIdentifier(). #2297, #2305\n\nStructure and Performance Improvements\n\nRefactored the CSS QueryParser into a clearer recursive descent parser. #2310.\nCSS selectors with consecutive combinators (e.g. div \u003e\u003e p) will throw an explicit parse exception. #2311.\nPerformance: reduced the shallow size of an Element from 40 to 32 bytes, and the NodeList from 32 to 24. #2307.\nPerformance: reduced GC load of new StringBuilders when tokenizing input HTML. #2304.\nMade Parser instances threadsafe, so that inadvertent use of the same instance across threads will not lead to errors. For actual concurrency, use Parser#newInstance() per thread. #2314.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nElement names containing characters invalid in XML are now normalized to valid XML names when serializing. #1496.\nWhen serializing to XML, characters that are invalid in XML 1.0 should be removed (not encoded). #1743.\nWhen converting a Document to the W3C DOM in W3CDom, elements with an attribute in an undeclared namespace now get a declaration of xmlns:prefix=\"undefined\". This allows subsequent serialization to XML via W3CDom.asString() to succeed. #2087.\nThe StreamParser could emit the final elements of a document twice, due to how onNodeCompleted was fired when closing out the stack. #2295.\nWhen parsing with the XML parser and error tracking enabled, the trailing ? in \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e would incorrectly emit an error. #2298.\nCalling Element#cssSelector() on an element with combining characters in the class or ID now produces the correct output. #1984.\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.20.1 (2025-04-29)\nChanges\n\nTo better follow the HTML5 spec and current browsers, the HTML parser no longer allows self-closing tags (\u003cfoo /\u003e)\nto close HTML elements by default.

    "description": "Why Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Link to JIRA ticket in description, if appropriate.\n Change is code complete and matches issue description.\n Appropriate unit or acceptance tests or explanation to why this change has no tests.\n Reviewer's manual test instructions provided in PR description. See Reviewer's first task below.\n\nReviewer checklist\n\n Run the changes and verified the change matches the issue description.\n Reviewed the code.\n Verified that the appropriate tests have been written or valid explanation given.\n If applicable, tested by installing this plugin on the Jenkins instance.",

With the option enabled it will determine the common base path for all the attachments for each test case. It will then maintain that relative directory structure when archiving the attachments for the build.\n\nTesting done\nTested for old builds created before change. Tested for new builds with and without option set.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "This PR allows you to - optionally - use a predefined token role when requesting new child tokens while limiting policies.\nInstead of requiring the requesting AppRole to have to include all possible token_policies (and then just using a subset), the requesting AppRole can just be granted a single policy again granting to create a token using a predefined token role (which can request other policies NOT already included within the token_policies)\nTesting done\nSorry, I still need to try to write tests. I am not really a Java developer (getting it all running - and debugging - was already quite a pain for me. I will try to add those.\nBut what I did:\n\nsetup a vault dev mode (with rudiment script)\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nvault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=dev-only-token \u0026\necho $! \u003e .vault.pid\n\nexport VAULT_TOKEN=dev-only-token\nexport VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200\n\n# enable approle auth method\nvault auth enable approle\n\n# enable dummy-secrets\nvault secrets enable -path=dummy-secrets -version=2 kv\n\n# create jenkins approle\nvault write auth/approle/role/jenkins \\\n  token_type=service \\\n  secret_id_ttl=43200m \\\n  token_ttl=10m \\\n  explicit_max_ttl=30m \\\n  secret_id_num_uses=0 \\\n  token_policies=\"jenkins_main\"\n\n# create token role\nvault write auth/token/roles/jenkins token_type=batch allowed_policies=\"dummy1,dummy2\" orphan=true renewable=false disallowed_policies=\"root,namespace-admin\"\n\n# get the role-id and echo that\necho \"The role-id for 'jenkins' is: $(vault read -format=json auth/approle/role/jenkins/role-id | jq -r '.data.role_id') ...\"\n\necho \"The secret-id for 'jenkins' is: $(vault write -f -format=json auth/approle/role/jenkins/secret-id | jq -r '.data.secret_id') ...\"\n\n# policies\n\nvault policy write dummy1 - \u003c\u003cEOF\npath \"dummy-secrets/data/*\" {\n  capabilities = [\"read\"]\n}\n\npath \"dummy-secrets/metadata/*\" {\n  capabilities = [\"read\"]\n}\nEOF\n\nvault policy write dummy2 - \u003c\u003cEOF\npath \"dummy-secrets/data/*\" {\n  capabilities = [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n}\n\npath \"dummy-secrets/metadata/*\" {\n  capabilities = [\"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\"]\n}\nEOF\n\nvault policy write jenkins_main - \u003c\u003cEOF\npath \"/auth/token/create/jenkins\" {\n  capabilities = [\"create\", \"update\"]\n}\nEOF\n\n# create dummy secret dummy1 (in dummy-secrets)\nvault kv put -mount=dummy-secrets dummy1 username=foo password=bar\n\necho \"Done.\"\n\nSo the AppRole jenkins is created with only policy jenkins_main assigned via token_policies. jenkins_main itself allows to create child tokens using the jenkins token role. When trying to create child tokens, only dummy1 or dummy2 maybe be used (possibility to use globbing). So in this example, dummy1 can read the secret at dummy-secrets/data/dummy1\nConfigure global Vault plugin by just providing the url, the AppRole and the path prefix dummy-secrets.\nWith that, using the slightly adjusted example from the README in a pipeline\nnode {\n    // define the secrets and the env variables\n    // engine version can be defined on secret, job, folder or global.\n    // the default is engine version 2 unless otherwise specified globally.\n    def secrets = [\n        [path: 'dummy1', secretValues: [\n            [envVar: 'username', vaultKey: 'username'],\n            [envVar: 'password', vaultKey: 'password']\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n\n    // optional configuration, if you do not provide this the next higher configuration\n    // (e.g. folder or global) will be used\n    def configuration = [policies: \"dummy1\", role: \"jenkins\"]\n\n    // inside this block your credentials will be available as env variables\n    withVault([configuration: configuration, vaultSecrets: secrets]) {\n        sh 'echo Username: $username'\n        sh 'echo Password: $password'\n    }\n}\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

However, to distinguish between a temporarily offline agent and a disconnected one, we often needed to add explicit checks like Computer#getChannel() != null.\nIntroducing isConnected simplifies this logic and makes it easier to understand the behavior of isOnline and isOffline, especially with the @see reference in their Javadoc.\nTesting done\nAutomated test\nProposed changelog entries\nNA\nProposed changelog category\n/label skip-changelog\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

Doing this will allow us to change the implementation with little if any change to the usages.\nI have also done a bit of renaming from Translations to a more standard and probably expected Messages class.\nI have added an index.ts file to try and help denote what is public and what is more \"package private\", I guess another way of doing this would be to merge files as my understanding of js/ts doesn't have quite the same visibility modifiers as what I'm used to with java\nTesting done\nUnit tests should handle any regression but I've also done a manual pass in Japanese.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "See JENKINS-75533.\nDuring development of this change, Spring Security added the backward compatibility I considered here, but without exposing the potential problem to users. I considered doing that for Jenkins, but there's no great way built-in to expose that information to users and ask them to change the password. I can do that if required, basically all of the code is written but I think unnecessary.\nAs a side effect of moving the validation into the PasswordHashEncoder this would address JENKINS-74918 as well, as demonstrated by the necessary test changes (password is shorter than 14 chars).\nDepends on jenkinsci/active-directory-plugin#241 which would break.\nTesting done\nScreenshots\nRegular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIPS-140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed changelog entries\n\nImprovement: Jenkins' own user database no longer accepts new passwords longer than supported by bcrypt (72 bytes). Users with longer passwords are advised to change their password.\nInternal: Switch jbcrypt implementation used for Jenkins' own user database from jbcrypt to Spring Security.\nRemove jbcrypt library. If you're using Active Directory plugin, make sure to update to version 2.40 at the same time as updating Jenkins.\nDeveloper: Remove org.connectbot:jbcrypt library from core BOM.\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label developer,dependencies,internal,rfe,removed\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nUnless operating in FIPS-140 mode, Jenkins' own user database no longer supports creating passwords longer than 72 bytes (UTF-8), which is the maximum length supported by the bcrypt password hashing function it uses. This length corresponds to 72 basic ASCII characters, 24-36 CJK characters, or 18 emoji ü§†.\nExisting passwords longer than 72 bytes can still be used to log in. \nUsers with longer passwords are advised to change their password to be at most 72 bytes (and, e.g., choose from a larger character set to achieve the same complexity).\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\n\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

Previously, if you did something like this:\ngson.fromJson(jsonString, new TypeToken\u003cImmutableList\u003cString\u003e\u003e() {})\n\nthen the inferred type would be ImmutableList\u003cString\u003e, but Gson actually gave you an ArrayList\u003cString\u003e. Usually that would lead to an immediate ClassCastException, but in some circumstances the code might sometimes succeed despite the wrong type. Now you will see an exception like this:\ncom.google.gson.JsonIOException: Abstract classes can't be instantiated!\nAdjust the R8 configuration or register an InstanceCreator or a TypeAdapter for this type.\nClass name: com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList\n\nbecause Gson now really is trying to create an ImmutableList through its constructor, but that isn't possible.\nEither change the requested type (in the TypeToken) to List\u003cString\u003e, or register a TypeAdapter or JsonDeserializer for ImmutableList.\n\n\nThe internal classes $Gson$Types and $Gson$Preconditions have been renamed to remove the $ characters. Since these are internal classes (as signaled not only by the package name but by the $ characters), client code should not be affected. If your code was depending on these classes then we suggest making a copy of the class (subject to the license) rather than depending on the new names.\n\n\nFull Changelog: google/gson@gson-parent-2.12.1...gson-parent-2.13.0\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n257bee9 [maven-release-plugin] prepare release gson-parent-2.13.1\n63d74b3 Bump the maven group with 5 updates (#2851)\n810e356 Add shrinker test for interface implementation being deserialized (#2845)\n00ae397 Adjust Troubleshooting Guide ProGuard / R8 section (#2844)\n0eec6f3 Remove outdated android-proguard-example (#2843)\n4e65e6a Give FieldNamingStrategy the ability to return multiple String names (#2776)\n6010131 [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration\nbfe0fd5 [maven-release-plugin] prepare release gson-parent-2.13.0\n6ed64ca add multi-catch support to the code base (#2841)\n0074376 Bump the maven group with 3 updates (#2840)\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

I was able to find an existing JIRA issue on the problem and so answered the question by linking to ticket.\nSeemed like a straightforward fix, so I decided to take a look myself after I saw it hadn't received a fix in a week or so.\nI'm otherwise a first-time Jenkins contributor, just coincidentally stumbled upon this\n\nTesting done\n\n\nmodified the test payload to account for GitHub's changes\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Hello bitbucket developers! üëã\nThis should help getting #118 to build.\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

The mapping will respect the order of a metric. E.g., for tests, large values are colored in green while for complexities, large values are colored in red. All non-coverage metrics will use this new auto-coloring.\nIn this first iteration, the color distribution is hard coded as a mapping of the actual node value as a ratio between the minimum and maximum value of all nodes. In a followup PR I will try to make the coloring customizable.",

    "description": "Hello global-slack-notifier developers! üëã\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17}\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

I'm currently looking into removing the former library from core, and this is the only plugin using it.\nSpring Security recently (Jenkins 2.502+) started rejecting passwords longer than 72 bytes, so this adds a bit of code to ensure we're not bumping into this limit.\nThis code is untested as the autotests did not manage to start containers (IIUC) on my system and I have no AD environment to test with. Happy to assist though if needed.\nTo test this, use passwords that are 71 (shorter than limit), 72 (exact limit), and 73+ bytes UTF-8 (~basic ASCII characters, or just ca. 18 emojis) long and expect the behavior to be as follows (unchanged from before), both on Jenkins before 2.502 and Jenkins 2.502+:\n\n71: Password must match exactly\n72: Password must match exactly or be longer (suffix is ignored)\n73+: Password must match 72-byte prefix only, rest is ignored.",

    "description": "Problem\nSee JENKINS-75589. The code that populates the regions in the UI was failing to populate the regions on some installations.\nEvaluation\nThe old code, prior to adoption of AWS Java SDK v2, implicitly set the region to us-east-1 by virtue of setting the endpoint to https://ec2.amazonaws.com which triggered a deprecated code path in the AWS Java SDK v1 to eventually assume a region of us-east-1. The deprecated code has been removed in AWS Java SDK v2. We were not setting a region explicitly, thus triggering this logic:\n\nConfigure the region with which the SDK should communicate.\nIf this is not specified, the SDK will attempt to identify the endpoint automatically using the following logic:\n\nCheck the aws.region system property for the region.\nCheck the AWS_REGION environment variable for the region.\nCheck the ${user.home}/.aws/credentials and ${user.home}/.aws/config files for the region.\nIf running in EC2, check the EC2 metadata service for the region.\n\nIf the region is not found in any of the locations above, an exception will be thrown at SdkBuilder.build() time.\n\nMy theory is that while many installations had a region already configured in ~/.aws or in the EC2 metadata service (e.g., if the controller was already running in EC2), many did not. Hence before they would have picked us-east-1 to list the regions, while after the migration to SDK v2 they would have triggered the exception mentioned in the last line above.\nSolution\nRestore the old behavior by setting the region based on the endpoint URL. The new v2 API does not have a convenience utility class for doing this, so I have reimplemented the logic based on the behavior of the v1 API.\nTesting done\n\nAdded new unit tests.\nTested interactively in JENKINS-75589 (comment).\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

Result is relatively ugly (suggestions welcome) as there is a large blank space between pane title and table row for textarea and buttons, but finally functionally it works:\n\nSome technical notes:\n\nI had to make this a separate pane, so it is not auto-refreshed by AJAX. Otherwise it was nearly impossible to edit the textbox - it was refreshing and emptied every second or two.\n\nIt would be cool to not-show this pane when there are fewer than 2 or 3 builds queued. Perhaps some javascript in the AJAX part to wholly hide or toggleCollapse this pane could help, but is out of my current ability (sadly the experiment took too much time already).\nI added the pane above the queue list, because the latter can be very long (hundreds of items in my use-case) so it takes a while to load and to scroll the browser exactly to the point where the Build Executors are (so finding and using this new pane would be similarly problematic).\n\n\nI made an \u003cf:entry\u003e around several table data cells in the row, assuming this can help the textbox and TWO buttons that can POST its contents see each other. Maybe this is overkill, did not check further - does work this way at least.\nThe original use of \u003cf:link\u003e in the list of queue items was not usable here, because server-side pre-generated URL does not really fit. After a lot of experiments, I settled on raw \u003cbutton\u003e as suggested by some comments in e.g. https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/838cafb8fb86fd843b85d2e22e957e09a1ce86a9/war/src/main/webapp/scripts/hudson-behavior.js#L919 makeButton and snatched onClick code from https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/838cafb8fb86fd843b85d2e22e957e09a1ce86a9/war/src/main/webapp/scripts/hudson-behavior.js#L2566 validateButton to POST what we need. The button wraps an \u003cimg\u003e tag (generated from \u003cl:icon\u003e as it was) so the buttons are seen as such but adorned by the image.\nI considered keeping the textbox empty and adding ~/ and / in onClick code, but keeping it pre-populated allows users to add i for case-insensitive match in the end. Also this reminds that the text should be a regex :)",

    "description": "This PR aims to migrate all tests in test (various packages) to JUnit5.

    "description": "This PR aims to migrate all tests in core (hudson package) to JUnit5. Changes include:\n\nMigrate annotations and imports\nMigrate assertions\nRemove public visibility for test classes and methods\nMinor clean up\n\nOther, releated PR: #10559 #10576 #10577 #10578 #10579 #10580 #10581 #10582\nWhy this is a good change:\n\nJUnit 5 is the modern standard: It offers a cleaner and more powerful programming model, better extensibility, and improved support for modern Java features (like lambdas, streams, and optional parameters).\nImproved test maintainability: JUnit 5‚Äôs more expressive annotations and lifecycle management make tests easier to read, write, and debug.\nEnables use of modern extensions: Migrating paves the way to leverage powerful third-party extensions and tooling (e.g., parameterized tests, dynamic tests, conditional execution).\n\nIt is important to notice that this change should not alter the test logic, but bring the project in line with modern best practices and help keeping it future-proof.\nThere are some exceptions were tests have not been migrated (see the list below). The reasons vary per class, overall it's mostly either some custom JenkinsRule implementations that as of now do not properly work with JUnit5. There are also cases where a migration would simply require too much effort with too much risk of altering a tests intentions.\n\nList of test classes not migrated to JUnit5\n\nAbstractItem2Test\nAgentInboundUrlTest\nApiTokenStatsRestartTest\nArgumentListBuilder2Test\nBasicHeaderApiTokenAuthenticatorTest\nBindTest\nBootFailureTest\nBuiltInNodeMigrationRestartTest\nClassicPluginStrategyTest\nCustomClassFilterTest\nCustomPluginManagerTest\nDisablePluginCommandTest\nDoubleLaunchCheckerTest\nErrorPageTest\nExtensionListListenerTest\nExtensionListRjrTest\nFileParameterValuePersistenceTest\nHudsonPrivateSecurityRealmFIPSTest\nInboundAgentTlsTest\nJNLPLauncherRealTest\nJenkins64991Test\nJenkinsBuildsAndWorkspacesDirectoriesTest\nJenkinsLocationConfigurationTest\nJenkinsLogRecordsTest\nJenkinsManagePermissionTest\nJenkinsSupportAnnotationsTest\nJenkinsTest\nJnlpAccessWithSecuredHudsonTest\nJnlpProtocol4ProxyHandlerTest\nJnlpSlaveRestarterInstallerTest\nLifecycleTest\nLoadDetachedPluginsTest\nLoginTest\nNameRefTest\nNodeParallelTest\nNodeProvisionerTest\nNodesRestartTest\nOfflineNodeCommandTest\nOldRemotingAgentTest\nPluginManagerInstalledGUITest\nPluginManagerTest\nProjectTest\nProxyConfigurationManagerGUITest\nQueueCrashTest\nQueueRestartTest\nResponseTimeMonitorTest\nReverseBuildTriggerAfterRestartTest\nReverseProxySetupMonitorTest\nRunActionTest\nSecurity218Test\nSecurity3430Test\nSecurity3501Test\nSecurity637Test\nSecurityContextExecutorServiceTest\nSetContextClassLoaderTest\nSetupWizardRestartTest\nSymbolJenkinsTest\nUnsupportedRemotingAgentEscapeHatchTest\nUnsupportedRemotingAgentTest\nUpdateCenterCustomTest\nUpdateCenterMigrationTest\nUserRestartTest\nUserSeedPropertyRestartTest\nWebSocketAgentsTest\nXStream2AnnotationTest\n\n\nI am well aware that this is a huge changeset however I hope that there is still interest in this PR and it will be reviewed.\nIf there are any questions, please do not hesitate to ping me.\nTesting done\nLot's of local testing.

A simpler solution would be to modify Lister itself, but it (technically) lives outside the Jenkins umbrella.\nTesting done\nThere is a new unit test which approximates the original issue.  This new test passes, all existing tests pass, and core Jenkins tests continue to pass when using this new version.  The change will impact four various ways of \"add something to a list\", but only explicitly tests one of them (the one relevant to the bug being fixed).  Testing for every path would take more effort and might be seen as over-specification, so I opted for simplicity until reviewed.\nI originally used DataBoundResolvable to mimic Jenkins-specific Descriptor#newInstance (since both leave the decision to return null to the class itself, and both document null as a valid return), but eventually opted to just use BindInterceptor since that was simpler and matched surrounding code.\nAs well, a manual test for the desired behavior in the ticket works (using this new stapler in lieu of the modified plugin.\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "#695 effectively removed the bridge method from the generated bytecode by removing bridge-method-injector from the build, but it did not remove the @WithBridgeMethod annotation, turning it into dead code. Since the intervening 6 years have clearly demonstrated that the bridge method is not actually needed, remove the useless annotation rather than adding bridge-method-injector back to the build.\nTesting done\nDumped the bytecode of the class with javap before and after this change and verified it was the same (i.e., no bridge method both before and after, as expected).\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
