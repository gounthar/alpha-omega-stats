This PR aims to resolve that by moving the action from a RootAction to a plain ol' Action - so it'll still appear on views as expected, but it won't appear in the header.\nRequires jenkinsci/jenkins#10676 to show the view action with the new header.\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

The new impl is much closer to the spec.\n\n\ncore-js: Named capture groups support added, more regexp fixes\n\n\nWebClient.setWebSocketAdapter(WebSocketAdapterFactory) added. This should help to use a different WebSocket implementation.\n\n\nWebSocketAdapter splitted into WebSocketAdapter and WebSocketListener. New interface WebSocketAdapterFactory introduced. This should help to make it simpler to use a different WebSocket implementation.\n\n\nPlease have a look at the full release notes for details about this release.\nüíï Thank you to all who have contributed and to the sponsors (more sponsoring is welcome https://github.com/sponsors/rbri).\nFull Changelog: HtmlUnit/htmlunit@4.11.1...4.12.0\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n0ca4b09 4.12.0\nfa52e09 add test case for issue #966\n0edd5bf start working towards 4.12.0\na379e5b fix typo\n4333df2 Bump actions/upload-artifact from 4.6.1 to 4.6.2\n92f693c unify and simplify code\n640856e cleanup\nd86b583 jdoc fix\neb2181d code style\n2df4954 introduce option NekoReaderBufferSize\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

    "description": "Ensure a connection is unique before adding it to the connection list.\nTo prevent data inconsistency caused by partially successful updates, the new list and map are only assigned after validation.\nAdditionally, GitLabConnectionConfig now overrides configure(StaplerRequest2, JSONObject) to avoid UI failures with no clear error messages on it. The validation exception will be caught and rethrown as FormException.\nAn error message for duplicate connection names already exists, so no additional message handling is required.\nHopefully, this can fix #1670. However, addConnection() still doesn't work as https://javadoc.jenkins.io/plugin/gitlab-branch-source/io/jenkins/plugins/gitlabserverconfig/servers/GitLabServers.html#addServer(io.jenkins.plugins.gitlabserverconfig.servers.GitLabServer) as described in the issue because instead of throwing an exception about it, addServer() there returns a boolean value to represent if the list is changed or not. Not sure if this is actually also wanted for addConnection() because there is no other place in the code that will examine the returned boolean value.\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

In order to bump certain versions of dependencies, and indeed the main Jenkins dependency itself, we need to first prepare the plugin for Java 17, as most dependencies don't support Java 11 since October 2024.\nBumping a few dependencies that requires security patching. As a part of this, Jenkins has stopped support for some versions that we are depending on, thus requiring a bump to versions only supporting Java 17 and onwards.

    "description": "Hello webhook-step developers! üëã\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

This enables users to manage Jenkins credentials through Kubernetes, streamlining credential management in containerized environments.\nChanges\n\nAdded KubernetesCredentialConverter class that implements SecretToCredentialConverter\nConfigured the Kubernetes Credentials Provider as an optional dependency\nAdded manifest entry to specify optional plugin dependency resolution\nEnhanced code with comprehensive documentation and error handling\n\nImplementation Details\nThe implementation allows Kubernetes secrets with the type com.crowdstrike.plugins.crwds.credentials.CredentialsDefault to be automatically converted to CrowdStrike Falcon API credentials in Jenkins. The converter extracts the client ID and client secret from the Kubernetes secret and creates the appropriate Jenkins credential.\nThe code includes:\n\nRobust error handling for missing or invalid secret data\nHelper methods for common operations like field decoding\nComprehensive logging for troubleshooting\n\nTesting\n\nTested with Kubernetes Credentials Provider Plugin\nSuccessfully created CrowdStrike Falcon API credentials from Kubernetes secrets\nVerified that the plugin works correctly without the Kubernetes Credentials Provider installed\n\nUsage Example\nUsers can create a Kubernetes secret like:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: crowdstrike-creds\n  annotations:\n    jenkins.io/credentials-description: \"CrowdStrike API Credentials\"\n    jenkins.io/credentials-type: \"com.crowdstrike.plugins.crwds.credentials.CredentialsDefault\"\ntype: Opaque\ndata:\n  clientId: \u003cbase64-encoded-client-id\u003e\n  clientSecret: \u003cbase64-encoded-client-secret\u003e\nDependencies\n\nThis feature requires the Kubernetes Credentials Provider Plugin to be installed\nThe dependency is marked as optional, so users must explicitly install it",

    "description": "This PR is a follow-up to #989, #979, and #883.\nSummary of Changes\nThis pull request addresses an issue in the ubi9-latest-tag.sh script, which is responsible for determining the latest UBI9 tag. The original script logic was flawed in how it parsed the JSON response from the registry API to identify the correct tag. This update modifies the jq command to more accurately extract the latest tag associated with the \"latest\" tag, specifically looking for tags that contain a hyphen (which indicates a long-form tag) and are not named \"latest\".\nHighlights\n\nBug Fix: The pull request fixes a bug in the ubi9-latest-tag.sh script that caused it to incorrectly identify the latest UBI9 tag.\nImproved Tag Parsing: The jq command in the script has been updated to more accurately parse the JSON response and extract the correct tag, ensuring that it selects tags associated with the \"latest\" tag that also contain a hyphen.\n\nChangelog\n\nupdatecli/scripts/ubi9-latest-tag.sh\n\nModified the jq command to correctly parse the JSON response and identify the latest UBI9 tag.\nAdded a filter to select tags associated with the \"latest\" tag that also contain a hyphen in their name.\nAdded comments to explain the logic of the jq command.\n\n\n\nTesting done\n./updatecli/scripts/ubi9-latest-tag.sh\n9.6-1745489786\nupdatecli diff --config ./updatecli/updatecli.d/rhel-ubi9.yaml --values .\n/updatecli/values.github-action.yaml\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "See JENKINS-75664.\n#10623 (comment) identified by bisection.\n#10623 (comment) was originally developed when I was using t:renderOnDemand. I subsequently decided not to use this (misconceived) system, but left in that change since it seemed helpful in other cases when configuring projects #10623 (comment). jenkinsci/stapler#663 and/or jenkinsci/stapler#665 probably suffice; it would be nicer to release memory deterministically rather than keeping an object around after it has been used and relying on some subsequent batch cleanup (like the difference between Closeable and Finalizer).\nTesting done\nJUnitPluginTest.publish_test_result_which_passed fails without this change and passes with it.\nI did not determine why this change caused the test failure. In the ATH, clicking the button to add a builder has no effect. But I cannot reproduce the same behavior interactively outside ATH (using Firefox in both cases).\nInteractively confirmed by creating a freestyle project and adding the shell step builder twice.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nA change to lazy rendering in 2.510 caused a regression in certain GUI configuration scenarios, such as adding two build steps of the same type (e.g., Execute shell) to a freestyle project at the same time. (The workaround is to add one builder, save, then reload the page and add the next.)\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label major-bug\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",
