    "description": "Bitbucket enhance its build status API with a refname (Cloud) and ref (Server) property to indicate the owner's git reference. This can be used as a sort of filter in case multiple build statuses have been associated with the same commit.\nFor example, this means that when browsing commits from the webpage, you will see all the build statuses associated with a commit (no scope); but, you should only see one when you land on the pull request webpage (scoped).\nNOTE: At the time of implementation once a build status is created, it cannot be deleted via the API. If refname is set, it cannot be set to null. The property appears to participate in some way in the primary key of the build status, multiple build statuses with the same key but different refnames are allowed, especially in the use case the update APIs return an HTTP 500 error.\nAvailable documentations:\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/rest/v903/api-group-builds-and-deployments/#api-api-latest-projects-projectkey-repos-repositoryslug-commits-commitid-builds-post\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-commit-statuses/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-commit-commit-statuses-build-post\ndoes not explain precisly how this property should be valued. This force me to set the property to null in case of pull request, otherwise, the build status disappear from the webpage and branch restriction and merge conditions will not work.\n\nSummary\nBitbucket Cloud\nConsidering only pages that show the build status, such as:\n\nSteps:\n\nCreate a branch feature/xyz\nOpen a PR feature/xyz -\u003e master\nMerge PR\n\nPull Requests\nIn the specific \"Pull Request\" page now shows only the build status binded to the last commit in branch feature/xyz. Build status binded to the same commit in the target branch (example: master) is not listed.\n\nYou will see only 1 of 1 build passed.\nThere is some strange behavior on the \"Pull Requests\" listing page, let's say you filter by \"Merged\", the icon on the right in the tooltips shows all build states associated with the commit, BUT if you click on the bitbucket icon it only shows you the build state related to the commit (the same way it did on the specific pull request page above):\n\nBefore these changes, all build states associated with the commit were listed:\n\nCommits\nIn the \"Commits\" page all build status (regardless the refname value) binded the commit are shown:\n\nBranches\nIn the \"Branches\" page  all build status (regardless the refname value) binded the commit are shown:",

It offers local symbols, symbols from Ionicons API (if added as a dependency in their POM file), and lastly from core. Invalid symbols (ones that aren't in our cache) are flagged as warnings to the user, and if possible a valid symbol is suggested.\n\n\nFuture enhancements could display the symbols directly in IntelliJ, and also offer suggestions for Java implementations of getIconFileName().\nTesting done\n\nWorks in Jenkins and Design Library\nAdded a rudimentary test to confirm suggestions show\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Pull Request - Extraction of HTTP Connection Manager in FullDuplexHttpStream.java\nSummary of the Change\nThis pull request refactors the FullDuplexHttpStream class by extracting the HTTP connection management logic into a separate class. This change improves the maintainability, readability, and testability of the code. Additionally, the class name have been updated to reflect the actual functionality more clearly.\nCode Smells Identified:\n\n\nLong Method: The FullDuplexHttpStream class method was overly long, handling both the HTTP connection creation and data transport logic, making it complex and difficult to understand.\n\n\nSingle Responsibility Principle Violation: The class was managing both the HTTP connection setup and the data transport, which violated the single responsibility principle.\n\n\nDuplicated Code: Connection configuration logic (such as establishing the connection, setting request methods, headers, etc.) was repeated for both upload and download streams.\n\n\nRefactoring Details:\n\n\nRefactoring 1: Extract HTTP Connection Logic:\n\nChanges: The HTTP connection management logic has been extracted into a new class called HttpConnectionManager. This refactor allows FullDuplexHttpStream to focus on managing the data streams, while the connection logic is handled by the new class.\nBenefit: Reduces the complexity of the FullDuplexHttpStream, promotes better maintainability, and enables easier unit testing of the connection logic.\n\n\n\nRefactoring 2: Misleading Class Name:\n\nCode Smell: The class name FullDuplexHttpStream was misleading, as the class actually handles two separate streams (upload and download), not a simultaneous full-duplex communication.\nChanges: The class was renamed to HttpUploadDownloadStream to better reflect its actual functionality.\nBenefit: The new name is clearer and more accurate, reducing potential confusion for developers working with the class.\n\n\n\nRefactoring Techniques Applied:\n\n\nExtract Class: The HTTP connection management logic was moved to a new class (HttpConnectionManager), which improves the cohesion of the FullDuplexHttpStream class.\n\n\nRename Class: The class was renamed to reflect the true nature of the class (upload/download streams), resolving the misleading name issue.\n\n\n\nTesting Done\n\n\nManual Testing:\n\nThe refactor was manually tested to ensure that the connection establishment, stream handling, and functionality remained intact.\nTesting included verifying both upload and download operations to ensure proper behavior after the changes.\n\n\n\nAutomated Testing:\n\nNo new automated tests were introduced. However, existing tests were run to confirm that no regressions occurred, and the system behaves as expected with the new class structure.\n\n\n\n\nProposed Changelog Entries\n\nExtracted the HTTP connection management logic into a new class HttpConnectionManager.\nRenamed the FullDuplexHttpStream class to HttpUploadDownloadStream for clarity.\nRefactored method names to better represent the class's functionality.\n\n\nProposed Upgrade Guidelines\nN/A\n\nSubmitter Checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate and written in the imperative mood.\n The change has been manually tested, and the behavior has been verified.\n No new public classes or methods require additional annotations.\n No new deprecations have been introduced.\n New or changed JavaScript does not use inline definitions or eval.\n For dependency updates, relevant changelogs have been linked.\n For new APIs, at least one consumer is referenced.\n\n\nDesired Reviewers\n\n@jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers\n\n\nMaintainer Checklist\n\n There are at least two approvals for the pull request.\n All conversations in the pull request are resolved.\n The changelog entries are accurate and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels have been set.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set.\n If this change should be backported to LTS, a Jira issue has been created with the lts-candidate label.",

    "description": "Pull Request - Improvements to CLI Protocol in PlainCLIProtocol.java\nSummary of the Change\nThis pull request refactors the PlainCLIProtocol class to improve the structure and readability of the code.\nCode Smells Identified:\n\nComplexity: The run() method was too complex with multiple responsibilities.\nDuplicated Code: Several validation operations were repeated in different parts of the code.\nMagic Numbers: Numeric literals used without explanation, which decreased code clarity.\nSwitch Statements: The use of switch statements for operation validation made the code difficult to extend and modify.\n\nRefactoring Details:\n\n\nRefactoring 1: Simplify FramedReader:\n\nChanges: The run() method was split into smaller methods: readFrameLength, processFrame, skipUnreadBytes, and handleException.\nBenefit: Improves readability and maintainability by reducing method complexity.\n\n\n\nRefactoring 2: Centralize Frame Validation:\n\nChanges: A new method, validateFrameLength, was created to centralize frame validation logic.\nBenefit: Reduces code duplication, improves clarity, and enables the reuse of validation logic.\n\n\n\nRefactoring 3: Add Direct Validation in Op:\n\nChanges: Validation for whether an operation is allowed was previously implicit in the handle method. It has now been moved to the Op enum as a direct method.\nBenefit: Clarifies the validation process and makes the logic more explicit.\n\n\n\nRefactoring 4: Eliminate switch for Operation Validation:\n\nChanges: The switch statements used for validating operations were replaced with polymorphism, moving the logic into the Op enum.\nBenefit: Makes the code easier to understand, extend, and modify without the risk of introducing errors when adding new operations.\n\n\n\nRefactoring Methods Used:\n\nSimplify FramedReader: Extract Method, Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses, Long Method - Duplicated Code\nCentralize Frame Validation: Extract Method, Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant - Duplicated Code, Magic Numbers\nValidation in Op: Move Method - Duplicated Code\nEliminate switch for Operation Validation: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism - Large Conditional (Switch Statements)\n\n\nTesting Done\n\n\nManual Testing:\n\nThe refactor has been manually tested to ensure that the logic remains intact. The functionality of sending and receiving data between the client and server, as well as frame validation, was verified.\nThe changes were tested for both typical and edge cases to confirm that the refactoring did not introduce regressions.\n\n\n\nAutomated Testing:\n\nNo new automated tests were introduced. However, the existing tests were run to verify that no existing functionality was broken.\n\n\n\n\nProposed Changelog Entries\n\nRefactored the PlainCLIProtocol class to improve readability and maintainability.\nSimplified the run() method in FramedReader by breaking it into smaller, focused methods.\nCentralized frame validation logic to reduce duplication and improve clarity.\nReplaced switch statements with polymorphism for operation validation, making the code easier to extend.\n\n\nProposed Upgrade Guidelines\nN/A\n\nSubmitter Checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate and written in the imperative mood.\n The change has been manually tested, and the behavior has been verified.\n No new public classes or methods require additional annotations.\n No new deprecations have been introduced.\n New or changed JavaScript does not use inline definitions or eval.\n For dependency updates, relevant changelogs have been linked.\n For new APIs, at least one consumer is referenced.\n\n\nDesired Reviewers\n\n@jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers\n\n\nMaintainer Checklist\n\n There are at least two approvals for the pull request.\n All conversations in the pull request are resolved.\n The changelog entries are accurate and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels have been set.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set.\n If this change should be backported to LTS, a Jira issue has been created with the lts-candidate label.",

    "description": "Pull Request - Refactor FlightRecorderInputStream Class\nSummary of the Change\nThis pull request refactors the FlightRecorderInputStream class by simplifying the analyzeCrash method. The method, which previously included complex logic for thread creation, has been refactored to delegate the thread creation into a new private method called createDiagnosisThread. This change improves the method's readability and maintainability, without altering its functionality.\nCode Smell Identified:\n\nThe analyzeCrash method was identified as having a high level of complexity, with the logic for thread creation embedded directly in the method.\n\nRefactoring Method:\n\nExtract Method: The logic for creating and initializing the thread was extracted into a new method called createDiagnosisThread to simplify the analyzeCrash method.\n\nBenefits:\n\nReadability: The analyzeCrash method is now cleaner and more focused on its primary responsibilities.\nReusability: The new createDiagnosisThread method can be reused if thread creation is needed elsewhere in the code.\n\n\nTesting Done\n\n\nManual Testing:\n\nThe refactor has been manually tested by verifying that the functionality of the FlightRecorderInputStream class remains intact.\nThe thread creation behavior has been preserved, and the refactor improves code structure without altering functionality.\n\n\n\nAutomated Testing:\n\nNo new automated tests were added as part of this refactor. However, the code was exercised manually to confirm that the changes did not break existing functionality.\n\n\n\n\nProposed Changelog Entries\n\nSimplified the analyzeCrash method by extracting thread creation logic into a new helper method, createDiagnosisThread.\n\n\nProposed Upgrade Guidelines\nN/A\n\nSubmitter Checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate and written in the imperative mood.\n The change has been manually tested, and the behavior has been verified.\n No new public classes or methods require additional annotations.\n No new deprecations have been introduced.\n New or changed JavaScript does not use inline definitions or eval.\n For dependency updates, relevant changelogs have been linked.\n For new APIs, at least one consumer is referenced.\n\n\nDesired Reviewers\n\n@jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers\n\n\nMaintainer Checklist\n\n There are at least two approvals for the pull request.\n All conversations in the pull request are resolved.\n The changelog entries are accurate and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels have been set.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set.\n If this change should be backported to LTS, a Jira issue has been created with the lts-candidate label.",

This additional query causes issues for us because the connection with the gerrit server is sometimes unstable.\nTesting done\nI updated src/test/java/com/sonyericsson/hudson/plugins/gerrit/trigger/hudsontrigger/GerritTriggerTest.java to include the new parameters and ran the tests in that file.\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to a Jenkins installation where I could do detailed testing of this change at the moment.\nHowever the additions are very similar to existing code and should be easy to audit if needed.\nI also ran the checkstyle \u0026 findbugs targets.\nLogs for each of the targets can be found as attachments :\ncheckstyle.txt\nfindbugs.txt\ntest.txt\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Bumps org.jsoup:jsoup from 1.18.1 to 1.18.2.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's releases.\n\njsoup 1.18.2\nImprovements\n\nOptimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing byte[] and char[]  arrays used to read and parse the input. 2186\nSpeed optimized html() and Entities.escape() when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. 2183\nThe form associated elements returned by FormElement.elements() now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. 2140\nIn the TreeBuilder, the onNodeInserted() and onNodeClosed() events are now also fired for the outermost / root Document node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And it also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. 2182\nSelected Elements can now be position swapped inline using Elements#set(). 2212\n\nBug Fixes\n\nElement.cssSelector() would fail if the element's class contained a *  character. 2169\nWhen tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left untracked. 2175\nWhen a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named html, it should be parsed in Quirks Mode. 2197\nWith a selector like div:has(span + a), the has() component was not working correctly, as the inner combining query caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not  children. 2187\nA selector query that included multiple :has() components in a nested :has() might incorrectly execute. 2131\nWhen cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via Connection.Response#cookies() will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use the Jsoup.newSession method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. 1831\nWhen parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). 2207\nFixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (html or body). 2204\nFollow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow \u003c as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. 2230\nSimilarly, allow a \u003c as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was intended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to how browsers behave. 1483\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.18.2 (2024-Nov-27)\nImprovements\n\nOptimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC\ndown between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs.

    "description": "This PR contains the following updates:\n\n\n\nPackage\nChange\nAge\nAdoption\nPassing\nConfidence\n\n\n\n\norg.jsoup:jsoup (source)\n1.18.1 -\u003e 1.19.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\njhy/jsoup (org.jsoup:jsoup)\nv1.19.1\nChanges\n\nAdded support for http/2 requests in Jsoup.connect(), when running on Java 11+, via the Java HttpClient\nimplementation. #​2257.\n\nIn this version of jsoup, the default is to make requests via the HttpUrlConnection implementation: use\nSystem.setProperty(\"jsoup.useHttpClient\", \"true\"); to enable making requests via the HttpClient instead ,\nwhich will enable http/2 support, if available. This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#​2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #​2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #​2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #​2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #​2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #​1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #​1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #​2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels. This is no\nlonger in the spec.\nAdded Elements.selectFirst(String cssQuery) and Elements.expectFirst(String cssQuery), to select the first\nmatching element from an Elements list.  #​2263\nWhen parsing with the XML parser, XML Declarations and Processing Instructions are directly handled, vs bouncing\nthrough the HTML parser's bogus comment handler. Serialization for non-doctype declarations no longer end with a\nspurious !. #​2275\nWhen converting parsed HTML to XML or the W3C DOM, element names containing \u003c are normalized to _ to ensure valid\nXML. For example, \u003cfoo\u003cbar\u003e becomes \u003cfoo_bar\u003e, as XML does not allow \u003c in element names, but HTML5\ndoes. #​2276\nReimplemented the HTML5 Adoption Agency Algorithm to the current spec. This handles mis-nested formating / structural elements. #​2278\n\nBug Fixes\n\nIf an element has an ; in an attribute name, it could not be converted to a W3C DOM element, and so subsequent XPath\nqueries could miss that element. Now, the attribute name is more completely\nnormalized. #​2244\nFor backwards compatibility, reverted the internal attribute key for doctype names to\n\"name\". #​2241\nIn Connection, skip cookies that have no name, rather than throwing a validation\nexception. #​2242\nWhen running on JDK 1.8, the error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.flip()Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;\ncould be thrown when calling Response#body() after parsing from a URL and the buffer size was\nexceeded. #​2250\nFor backwards compatibility, allow null InputStream inputs to Jsoup.parse(InputStream stream, ...), by returning\nan empty Document. #​2252\nA template tag containing an li within an open li would be parsed incorrectly, as it was not recognized as a\n\"special\" tag (which have additional processing rules). Also, added the SVG and MathML namespace tags to the list of\nspecial tags. #​2258\nA template tag containing a button within an open button would be parsed incorrectly, as the \"in button scope\"\ncheck was not aware of the template element. Corrected other instances including MathML and SVG elements,\nalso. #​2271\nAn :nth-child selector with a negative digit-less step, such as :nth-child(-n+2), would be parsed incorrectly as a\npositive step, and so would not match as expected. #​1147\nCalling doc.charset(charset) on an empty XML document would throw an\nIndexOutOfBoundsException. #​2266\nFixed a memory leak when reusing a nested StructuralEvaluator (e.g., a selector ancestor chain like A B C) by\nensuring cache reset calls cascade to inner members. #​2277\nConcurrent calls to doc.clone().append(html) were not supported. When a document was cloned, its Parser was not cloned but was a shallow copy of the original parser. #​2281\n\nv1.18.3\nBug Fixes\n\nWhen serializing to XML, attribute names containing -, ., or digits were incorrectly marked as invalid and\nremoved. 2235\n\nv1.18.2\nImprovements\n\nOptimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC\ndown between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see\nthroughput increases of ~ 20%.

and\nrelative worktree paths (requires Git 2.48.0), a new object transfer batch\nsize configuration option, better path handling when installing on Windows,\nmore POSIX-compliant hook scripts, and improved performance with sparse\ncheckouts, partial clones, and Git remotes with large numbers of tags.\n\nNote that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases will be the last releases\nfor which we provide packages or support for versions of any Linux\ndistribution based on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) or\nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SLES 12).\n\nNote also that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases may be the last\nreleases for which we provide packages or support for versions of any\nLinux distribution based on Debian 10 (\"buster\").\n\nThis release is built using Go v1.23 and therefore on macOS systems\nrequires macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, and on Windows systems requires\nat least Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 (although Windows 8.1 may\nsuffice).\n\nWe would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source\ncontributors:\n\n* @blanet for fixing a crash bug when handling HTTP 429 responses\n* @bogomolets-owl for implementing a batch size configuration option\n* @ConcurrentCrab for preventing hung SSH transfer protocol connections\n* @jochenhz for ensuring files with Unicode names are not accidentally pruned\n* @pastelsky for

When enabled, the plugin will sort the JUnit XML files by their last modification timestamp (from oldest to newest) before importing them. This ensures that test results are processed in the order they were generated, providing a more accurate representation of test execution order.\nKey Changes\nAdded a new boolean parameter sortTestResultsByTimestamp to the JUnitParser and JUnitResultArchiver.\nImplemented sorting logic in the JUnitParser to sort test result files by last modification date when the option is enabled.\nUpdated the plugin configuration UI to include the new option.\nMaintained backward compatibility by keeping the default behavior (sorting by file name) when the option is not enabled.\nTesting done\nUnit Tests\nAdded unit tests in JUnitParserTest and JUnitResultArchiverTest to verify that test result files are correctly sorted by last modification date when sortTestResultsByTimestamp is enabled.\nTested scenarios with multiple files having different and identical modification times.\nManual Testing\nDeployed the modified plugin in a local Jenkins instance.\nCreated a test job that generates multiple JUnit XML files with varying modification timestamps.\nVerified that when sortTestResultsByTimestamp is enabled, the test results are imported in the correct order.\nConfirmed that when the option is disabled, the files are processed in file name order.\nBuild Verification\nRan mvn clean install to build the plugin and ensure all tests pass.\nChecked for any compiler warnings or errors.\nSubmitter checklist\nMake sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\nEnsure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\nPlease describe what you did\nLink to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\nIssue Link: JENKINS-65532\nLink to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\nEnsure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Problem\nWhile working on Blue Ocean CSP compatibility recently, I discovered that the CSP plugin does not add the CSP header to Blue Ocean pages.\nSolution\nThis PR addresses the issue by adding the CSP header at the filter layer. At the filter layer, the StaplerRequest is not yet initialized, so we cannot populate the context for reporting purposes. So we retain the existing PageDecorator for the purposes of filling in the context. So before this PR, we set the header with proper context but only for some pages. After this PR, we always set the header, but only with proper context for some pages. This is a strict improvement over the status quo, as the existing status quo is retained with this PR with the additional benefit of adding the header (without context) for additional pages. Adding the header without context isn't great for debugging purposes, but it is effective at enforcing CSP for security purposes.\nImplementation\nThe use of HttpServletFilter necessitated a core bump to 2.479.1 LTS.\nFuture work\nA future improvement to this PR could try to create a minimal context at the filter layer that includes just the URL without information about Stapler ancestor objects. I am not sure if the current user is initialized at this layer, but it would be worth trying to add that as well.\nTesting done\n\nVerified that Blue Ocean erroneously loaded when in CSP restrictive mode before this PR and before my Blue Ocean fixes.\nVerified that Blue Ocean correctly failed to load when in CSP restrictive mode after this PR and before my Blue Ocean fixes.\nVerified that Blue Ocean correct loaded when in CSP restrictive mode after this PR and after my Blue Ocean fixes.\nVerified that the context was still present as before when loading normal pages.\nVerified that the Blue Ocean pages at least had the CSP header, even if they did not have context.\nVerified in a debugger that setting the CSP header in DirectoryBrowserSupport, FormFieldValidator, and FormValidation worked as before this PR. That is, this PR sets the header at the filter layer, but those three classes override it correctly, resulting in the same header being ultimately sent out as before this PR.\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

The overrides feature could be used for this, but it was introduced in NPM version 8, while we are still on NPM 6.14.4. NPM 6.14.4 doesn't natively support overrides, but we can use the npm-force-resolutions package to enforce specific versions for dependencies as recommended here. This PR sets up that package as described in its README, then uses it to override the version of isemail to 2.1.2.\nTesting done\nTested together with #2587, #2588, and\ndiff --git a/blueocean-web/src/main/resources/io/jenkins/blueocean/BlueOceanUI/index.jelly b/blueocean-web/src/main/resources/io/jenkins/blueocean/BlueOceanUI/index.jelly\nindex dc61f3c0d..fa7e41d48 100644\n--- a/blueocean-web/src/main/resources/io/jenkins/blueocean/BlueOceanUI/index.jelly\n+++ b/blueocean-web/src/main/resources/io/jenkins/blueocean/BlueOceanUI/index.jelly\n@@ -1,6 +1,7 @@\n \u003c?jelly escape-by-default='true'?\u003e\n \u003cj:jelly xmlns:j=\"jelly:core\" xmlns:st=\"jelly:stapler\" xmlns:x=\"jelly:xml\"\u003e\n     \u003cst:contentType value=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\"/\u003e\n+    \u003cst:header name=\"Content-Security-Policy\" value=\"default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: ; script-src 'self' 'report-sample' usage.jenkins.io\" /\u003e\n \n     \u003c!-- Add HTTP headers from extensions.

    "description": "Issue(s)\n\nAs mentioned by recent comments on JENKINS-69410 there are still broken URL links created for artifacts deployed. Those links are related to artifacts that are attached in addition to a modules primary artifacts.\ne.g. -sources.jar artifacts attached by the Maven sources plugin do not get proper links in case the deploy plugin will create time stamped filenames deployed (which is the most common usage for deployed snapshot artifacts).\nIf the deploy repository URL configured is ending with a / character, then the deployed artifact URL link is containing a //. This issue is fixed by this PR as well.\n\nRoot cause\ns. details in the commit comment\nTesting done\nThis has been tested manually for a couple of more or less complex multi module Maven projects with a couple of our companies product specific file types attached.\nExisting unit tests did not have been updated yet with this PR since of time constraints.\n@bguerin If you could help by giving some hint what test files and unit tests to focus on for an update, maybe I can find some time to cover this.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
