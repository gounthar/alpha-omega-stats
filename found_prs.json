So won't work in CSP restrictive mode unless default policy is relaxed. I though about bumping up the React version, as 16.x seems quite old, but haven't tried it yet. Also stylesheets and fonts are requested from external websites.

    "description": "Backporting for 2.479.3 LTS (part 2)\nLatest core version: jenkins-2.492 (unreleased)\nFixed\n-----\n\nJENKINS-75077           Minor                   2.492 (unreleased)\n        Upgrade Apache MINA core from 2.0.26 to 2.0.27\n        https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-75077\n\nThe pull request to the master branch has been merged for inclusion in the 7 Jan 2025 release of Jenkins 2.492.\n\n#10096\n\nThe Apache MINA core library has reported CVE-2024-52046, an issue for MINA users that use ioBuffer.getObject(). Jenkins is not affected by the issue, but software composition analysis tools will report it as a vulnerability and we'll spend time explaining that Jenkins is not vulnerable.\nLet's backport the change to the stable-2.479 line so that it can be part of Jenkins 2.479.3\nThis is an exception to the policy that we only backport to an LTS after a change has been merged to the Jenkins weekly release. I think this exception should be approved so that we reduce the amount of time that the Jenkins security team must spend explaining that Jenkins is not vulnerable to this issue. It is simpler to include the updated library plugin than to spend time explaining why this is not an issue.\nChanges included in this upgrade are:\n\n2.14.0-127.v40e03d37b_308 - Upgrade mina-sshd from 2.13.2 to 2.14.0\n2.14.0-131.v04e9b_6b_e0362 - Fix support for BCFIPS Security\n2.14.0-133.vcc091215a_358 - fips-bundle-test should be test scope and no need of commons-io in dptMngt\n2.14.0-136.v4d2b_0853615e - Use Apache Mina NIO2 framework instead of jdk provided NIO2 framework\n2.14.0-138.v6341ee58e1df - MINA core 2.0.26 to 2.0.27\n\nTesting done\nI've been using the updated API plugin in my Jenkins controller since shortly after it was released.  I've used the preceding releases in Jenkins LTS and in Jenkins weekly releases.

    "description": "Previously, the unexport of a step's body would only happen when scheduling the next execution (async mode).  If the step was not run async (due to having an outcome set prior to the step starting), the body was not removed until the CpsThreadGroup was finishing.  At this point the body's presence was treated as a resource leak and logged a warning.  Doing an explicit unexport for the sync case at the proper time eliminates the warnings from the fall-back cleanup.\n\nPotential fix for https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-75067\nI'm not sure if this solution is \"correct\", but it logically makes sense and all existing tests continue to pass.  Even if the proper fix is different (and/or best handled by you folks), I figured this PR could still prove valuable by providing a test case.\nTesting done\n\nI created a new test representing the scenario that led me to creating the original issue.  There are two relevant assertions; both fail without my change, and pass after the change.  I don't think both are needed, but didn't know which would be preferred.  The assertion for the (lack of) warning log is obviously simpler and asserts what I truly cared about.  The other asserts based on state, which seemed to be the better approach, but feels a bit heavy/hacky (but it's the best I could come up with without touching unrelated code).\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

As a result, the parent of the current folder will be copied.\nAfter the change, if the user tries to submit a new item when both 'job type' and 'copy from' are unset, the user will be prompted to specify which item to copy from.

I doubt that the label in the constructor has ever been null, but it is easy to safeguard those two methods so that they are null-safe.\nThe test code incorrectly tested the equals contract of the wrong class due to my copy and paste error.  Test the correct class.\nUses the simple() verifier because the UpstreamCause class seems to have complications related to its superclass and I'd rather not spend the time to investigate further.  The simple() verifier detected the null pointer exceptions, so it is still better than not testing.\nSpecial thanks to @code-arnab for detecting and reporting the mistake in #371 (comment)\nTesting done\nAutomated tests pass locally on Linux.

See \"What's new\" below. ✍️🤖\nBehaviour changes\n\nAction input git-token has been renamed branch-token, to be more clear about its purpose. The branch-token is the token that the action will use to create and update the branch.\nThe action now handles requests that have been rate-limited by GitHub. Requests hitting a primary rate limit will retry twice, for a total of three attempts. Requests hitting a secondary rate limit will not be retried.\nThe pull-request-operation output now returns none when no operation was executed.\nRemoved deprecated output environment variable PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER. Please use the pull-request-number action output instead.\n\nWhat's new\n\nThe action can now sign commits as github-actions[bot] when using GITHUB_TOKEN, or your own bot when using GitHub App tokens. See commit signing for details.\nAction input draft now accepts a new value always-true. This will set the pull request to draft status when the pull request is updated, as well as on creation.\nA new action input maintainer-can-modify indicates whether maintainers can modify the pull request. The default is true, which retains the existing behaviour of the action.\nA new output pull-request-commits-verified returns true or false, indicating whether GitHub considers the signature of the branch's commits to be verified.\n\nWhat's Changed\n\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.36 to 18.19.39 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3000\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.1.5 to 29.2.0 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3008\nbuild(deps-dev): bump prettier from 3.3.2 to 3.3.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3018\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.0 to 29.2.2 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3019\nbuild(deps-dev): bump eslint-plugin-prettier from 5.1.3 to 5.2.1 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3035\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.39 to 18.19.41 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3037\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.2 to 6.19.4 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3036\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.2 to 29.2.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3038\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.41 to 18.19.42 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3070\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.4 to 6.19.5 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3086\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.42 to 18.19.43 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3087\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.3 to 29.2.4 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3088\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.5 to 6.19.7 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3145\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.43 to 18.19.44 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3144\nUpdate distribution by @​actions-bot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3154\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.7 to 6.19.8 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3213\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.44 to 18.19.45 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3214\nUpdate distribution by @​actions-bot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3221\nbuild(deps-dev): bump eslint-import-resolver-typescript from 3.6.1 to 3.6.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3255\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.45 to 18.19.46 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3254\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.4 to 29.2.5 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3256\nv7 - signed commits by @​peter-evans in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3057\n\nNew Contributors\n\n@​rustycl0ck made their first contribution in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3057\n\nFull Changelog: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6.1.0...v7.0.0\nCreate Pull Request v6.1.0\n✨ Adds pull-request-branch as an action output.\nWhat's Changed\n\n\n...

    "description": "Bumps com.google.crypto.tink:tink from 1.15.0 to 1.16.0.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from com.google.crypto.tink:tink's releases.\n\nTink Java v1.16.0\nTink is a multi-language, cross-platform library that provides simple and misuse-proof APIs for common cryptographic tasks.\nThis is Tink Java 1.16.0\nWhat's new\nThe complete list of changes since 1.15.0 can be found here.\n\nAdded new API AndroidKeystore, which is now the preferred way to interact with the Android Keystore.\nBefore this release, the decision whether to use Conscrypt was done at time of class loading of some specific internal classes. If Conscrypt was not installed before the specific class for a primitive was loaded, Conscrypt was never used. Now, the decision is made whenever a new primitive is instantiated.\nIn HPKE, use Conscrypt implementation of X25519 when available. On Android, it is available since API version 31. This makes HPKE both faster and uses less memory.\nUpdated deps:\n\nprotobuf (4.28.2)\n\n\nAllow @AccessesPartialKey to be applied to fields and local variables, as well as methods and classes.\nAdded support for X-AES-GCM, which is an AEAD algorithm with extended nonce. It uses AES-CMAC for key derivation and AES-GCM for encryption. It is a generalization of the specification in https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM.\nAdded configurations that allow specifying what key types are when using Tink in your application. Tink provides defaults (ConfigurationV0) that are backwards compatible with behavior before configs were introduced.\n\nFuture work\nTo see what we're working towards, check our project roadmap.\nGetting started\nTo get started using Tink, see the setup guide.\nMaven:\n\u003cdependency\u003e\n    \u003cgroupId\u003ecom.google.crypto.tink\u003c/groupId\u003e\n    \u003cartifactId\u003etink\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n    \u003cversion\u003e1.16.0\u003c/version\u003e\n\u003c/dependency\u003e\n\nGradle:\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.crypto.tink:tink-android:1.16.0'\n}\n\nBazel:\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\nRULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = \"4.5\"\nRULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA =\"b17d7388feb9bfa7f2fa09031b32707df529f26c91ab9e5d909eb1676badd9a6\"\n\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n...

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using StandardCharsets for consistency. (45e6be2688)\nbase: Added ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues(). (f5ec2ab85c)\ncollect: Added an optimized copyOf method to TreeRangeMap. (a46565dd1c)\ncollect.testing: Fixed @Require annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)\nio: Changed ByteSink and CharSink to no longer call flush() in some cases before close(). This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden close() to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the close() override to at least call flush(). (6ace8bc8ea)\nnet: Added HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC and MediaType.CBOR.

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using StandardCharsets for consistency. (45e6be2688)\nbase: Added ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues(). (f5ec2ab85c)\ncollect: Added an optimized copyOf method to TreeRangeMap. (a46565dd1c)\ncollect.testing: Fixed @Require annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)\nio: Changed ByteSink and CharSink to no longer call flush() in some cases before close(). This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden close() to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the close() override to at least call flush(). (6ace8bc8ea)\nnet: Added HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC and MediaType.CBOR.

    "description": "Motivation\nThe AWS SDK for Java v2 has some changes in how EC2 clients are constructed with regard to the region, as described here. It is not clear how to implement these changes for Eucalyptus clouds, which do not have a region. After thinking about this some more, I decided it would be simpler to remove support for Eucalyptus clouds. This solves the problem about how to adapt to v2 API changes by eliminating the problem for Eucalyptus clouds, leaving only Amazon EC2 clouds for which the solution is straightforward.\nThe last commit to https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus was 7 years ago, and the entire GitHub organization was archived on August 30, 2024. This technology seems dead. I could find no references in open PRs after 2013, except for developers working on routine maintenance wondering how to deal with this dead code (usually guessing at the changes needed, or making changes without testing). The last references I can find in Jira are from 2016/2017, which roughly matches the timeline here showing that the last release of Eucalyptus was in 2018. Since this was over 6 years ago, I can't imagine anyone still using this technology today, and if they are then it seems like lack of support in the Jenkins EC2 plugin would be the least of their problems.\nProblem\nEucalyptus support is dead code.\nSolution\nFlense it.\nImplementation\nDelete all Eucalyptus-related code. With that out of the way, flatten the class hierarchy by deprecating AmazonEC2Cloud (now the only type of EC2Cloud again, as it was before Eucalyptus support was introduced) and pushing up all its functionality into EC2Cloud. This restores the status quo before Eucalyptus support was added.\nPreserve compatibility for serialized XML and JCasC. For XML, update the XStream alias to add EC2Cloud as an implementation so that deserialized instances of EC2Cloud are EC2Cloud rather than the deprecated AmazonEC2Cloud (which is also needed for JCasC export to work, since the descriptor is now part o EC2Cloud). Retain the alias, though, so that instances of AmazonEC2Cloud that are created via Groovy scripts still get serialized to the same EC2Cloud class as before this PR. Add @Symbol(\"amazonEC2\") so that JCasC import/export works as before with no changes to import or export.\nTesting done\nConfirmed that JCasC export had the same symbols as before. Confirmed that XML from the old version was readable and that new clouds saved with the changes from this PR were saved with the same XML as before this PR.\nConfirmed that Groovy scripts with the old types still worked using the deprecated constructors and were serialized into the same format as before this PR.\nRan JCasC tests with these changes and jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin#2611 successfully.",

    "description": "Description\nSee JENKINS-75058. See also jenkins-infra/jenkins.io#7770 for greater context around this change. For now this is a draft PR. I will go through the PR and add review comments to help clarify things.\nThis PR adds new configuration options to GitHub App credentials that make use of the repositories and permissions parameters when using the /app/installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens GitHub API endpoint to create installation access tokens.\nThere are two new high-level options:\n\nThe \"Repository access strategy\" uses the repositories parameter to control which repositories are available to the installation access tokens. There are three strategies, please see the changes to docs/github-app.adoc and the corresponding help-*.html for details.\nThe \"Default permissions strategy\" uses the permissions parameter to control which permissions are available to the installation access tokens, but only when the tokens are generated and used in an untrusted context. There are three strategies, please see the changes to docs/github-app.adoc for details.\n\nIf you have any recommendations for renaming of these options or any of their sub-options, please feel free to suggest them.\nI will go through and add comments to the PR to various points of interest. Please feel free to ask about anything that is not clear.\nBackwards compatibility:\n\nThe new configuration options are not fully backwards compatible. When migrating existing credentials which do not have the owner field set, we can 1) either preserve compatibility for users who have the app installed in multiple orgs and only use the credentials in contexts where owner inference is supported by using AccessInferredOwner as the migration, or 2) we can preserve compatibility for users who have the app installed in a single org and use it in contexts where inference is not supported by using AccessSpecifiedRepositories with a null owner. None of the new strategies currnetly support these two use cases simultaneously.\n\nNotes for downstream plugins:\n\nAny downstream plugin that wants to use GitHub App credentials to access the GitHub API now must use Connector.lookupScanCredentials so that the retrieved credentials recognize that they are in a trusted context so that the generated token is not restricted. See for example jenkinsci/github-checks-plugin#398.\nThe GitHubAppCredentials.getOwner and setOwner methods should no longer be used. The following plugins along with a CloudBees-internal one will need (minor) updates to match this PR. I will file PRs for this soon:\n\njenkinsci/kubernetes-credentials-provider-plugin#107\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/github-app-kubernetes-credentials-plugin/blob/95f09eaeb1eaf98443b3ed2fc5105f187a424063/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_app_kubernetes_credentials/GithubAppCredentialsConvertor.java#L64 is technically incompatible, but I think this plugin is obsolete after jenkinsci/kubernetes-credentials-provider-plugin#50, and so I have not tried to update it.)\nCloudBees-internal ticket for the proprietary plugin that needed updates\n\n\n\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Link to JIRA ticket in description, if appropriate.\n Change is code complete and matches issue description\n Automated tests have been added to exercise the changes\n Reviewer's manual test instructions provided in PR description. See Reviewer's first task below.\n\nReviewer checklist\n\n Run the changes and verify that the change matches the issue description\n Reviewed the code\n Verified that the appropriate tests have been written or valid explanation given\n\nDocumentation changes\n\n Link to jenkins.io PR, or an explanation for why no doc changes are needed\n\nUsers/aliases to notify",

    "description": "Automated test suites (PCT + ATH) run by CloudBees CI against recent trunk code turned up numerous cryptic JavaScript failures; for example the button in a credentials dropdown to open a dialog to create new credentials would just report an error about missing window.dialog and do nothing, and so all acceptance tests using credentials failed. I tracked these down to an initial error\nUncaught TypeError: headerCommandPaletteButton is null\n    command_palette_init index.js:40\n    7807 app.js:11\n\nIn most cases this was because CloudBees CI overrides JenkinsHeader (#5909) and the replacement does not currently include the same search box functionality as in Jenkins. #7569 however included initialization code presuming that (for example) button-open-command-palette existed, and did not gracefully skip execution if it was absent, such as if a custom header were in use.\nIn another case I found, a page was using \u003cl:layout type=\"full-screen\" …\u003e (#2445) which also omits this search box (but otherwise loads stock JavaScript). In fact Jenkins OSS does this in the setup wizard, and you can see this error by running that. It is mostly harmless in that context: stock JS fails to initialize, but was not being used anyway, and so the only apparent symptom is a warning in the browser log. An HtmlUnit-based test caught this.\nTesting done\nNew functional test here, and also seems to correct automated test failures in CloudBees CI.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nSince 2.489, JavaScript errors could be seen in some Jenkins pages omitting the usual header bar, such as the setup wizard.\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nDesired reviewers\n@janfaracik\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\n\n  \n    \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

from Jenkins leading to test failure because the startup command hadn't completed\nas I was executing all the tests noticed that the logs seemed hanging because the build logs weren't printing to the terminal - so improved logging a bit.\nupdates to the readme.\nFixed the jenkins.test.timeout configurations.\n\nThis PR is containing some of these fixes I made and associated documentation and scripts.\nAll integration tests are working ✅\nInfrastructure creation with Windows is also not working ❌ (because the windows-2016 image is not found in the mention location in the doc anymore; will

    "description": "I've really wanted to do this one for a while, combination of waiting for tooling and browser support to catch up. This PR uses oklch for colours to ensure that our palette is consistent (e.g. colours used for tables, cards, buttons all inherit from the same colour and only have to be defined once).\nThis change won't have much visual impact on Jenkins, but it will ensure that things are consistent in a way that wasn't easy to do so before. You'll notice slight hue changes here and there across the UI, and actual colours will pop a little bit more depending on if your display supports it.\n\nThis change also makes it easier for theme developers, say if a developer wanted to develop an 'Accent colour' plugin they'd only need to update one variable (--accent-color) and Jenkins would reflect that across the UI.\n\nChanging the accent colour property can have quite an impact on the overall interface now\nWhy oklch?\n\nOKLCH frees designers from the need to manually choose every color. Designers can define a formula, choose a few colors, and an entire design system palette is automatically generated.\nOKLCH can be used for wide-gamut P3 colors. For instance, new devices (like those from Apple) can display more colors than old sRGB monitors, and we can use OKLCH to specify these new colors.\nUnlike hsl(), OKLCH is better for color modifications and palette generation. It uses perceptual lightness, so no more unexpected results, like we had with darken() in Sass.\nFurther, with its predictable lightness, OKLCH provides better a11y.\nUnlike rgb() or hex (#ca0000), OKLCH is human readable. You can quickly and easily know which color an OKLCH value represents simply by looking at the numbers. OKLCH works like HSL, but it encodes lightness better than HSL.\n\nFrom https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl\nTesting done\n\nTried in Safari + Chrome\nTried in Firefox + Firefox ESR\n\nBOM test: jenkinsci/bom#4187 (in progress)\nProposed changelog entries\n\nUse oklch for the Jenkins UI\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

See \"What's new\" below. ✍️🤖\nBehaviour changes\n\nAction input git-token has been renamed branch-token, to be more clear about its purpose. The branch-token is the token that the action will use to create and update the branch.\nThe action now handles requests that have been rate-limited by GitHub. Requests hitting a primary rate limit will retry twice, for a total of three attempts. Requests hitting a secondary rate limit will not be retried.\nThe pull-request-operation output now returns none when no operation was executed.\nRemoved deprecated output environment variable PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER. Please use the pull-request-number action output instead.\n\nWhat's new\n\nThe action can now sign commits as github-actions[bot] when using GITHUB_TOKEN, or your own bot when using GitHub App tokens. See commit signing for details.\nAction input draft now accepts a new value always-true. This will set the pull request to draft status when the pull request is updated, as well as on creation.\nA new action input maintainer-can-modify indicates whether maintainers can modify the pull request. The default is true, which retains the existing behaviour of the action.\nA new output pull-request-commits-verified returns true or false, indicating whether GitHub considers the signature of the branch's commits to be verified.\n\nWhat's Changed\n\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.36 to 18.19.39 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3000\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.1.5 to 29.2.0 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3008\nbuild(deps-dev): bump prettier from 3.3.2 to 3.3.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3018\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.0 to 29.2.2 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3019\nbuild(deps-dev): bump eslint-plugin-prettier from 5.1.3 to 5.2.1 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3035\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.39 to 18.19.41 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3037\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.2 to 6.19.4 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3036\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.2 to 29.2.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3038\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.41 to 18.19.42 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3070\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.4 to 6.19.5 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3086\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.42 to 18.19.43 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3087\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.3 to 29.2.4 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3088\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.5 to 6.19.7 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3145\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.43 to 18.19.44 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3144\nUpdate distribution by @​actions-bot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3154\nbuild(deps): bump undici from 6.19.7 to 6.19.8 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3213\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.44 to 18.19.45 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3214\nUpdate distribution by @​actions-bot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3221\nbuild(deps-dev): bump eslint-import-resolver-typescript from 3.6.1 to 3.6.3 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3255\nbuild(deps-dev): bump @​types/node from 18.19.45 to 18.19.46 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3254\nbuild(deps-dev): bump ts-jest from 29.2.4 to 29.2.5 by @​dependabot in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3256\nv7 - signed commits by @​peter-evans in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3057\n\nNew Contributors\n\n@​rustycl0ck made their first contribution in peter-evans/create-pull-request#3057\n\nFull Changelog: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6.1.0...v7.0.0\nCreate Pull Request v6.1.0\n✨ Adds pull-request-branch as an action output.\nWhat's Changed\n\n\n...

I have tested this only lightly and it did not work out of the box due to class loading issues. I was able to work around those with core's SetContextClassLoader, but I did not have time to investigate the root cause yet. So I am keeping this PR in draft. With more testing and debugging, perhaps we can find the root cause and get this functionality to work without class loading errors out of the box; otherwise, perhaps we can document the workaround. I am not entirely sure if these libraries are actually needed, so if they are not needed then this PR can simply be closed without any issue.",
