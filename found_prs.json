Changes include:\n\nMigrate annotations and imports\nMigrate assertions\nRemove public visibility for test classes and methods\nMinor clean up\n\nThere is one exception where a migration was not possible as the tests rely on Rule implementations that have not (yet) been migrated to JUnit5:\n\nThrottleJobPropertyPipelineRestartTest using JenkinsSessionRule (in combination with SemaphoreStep)\n\nI also took the freedom of re-enabling ThrottleConcurrentTest and refactor it to no longer rely on jgiven.\nIMHO there is no need for this test in particualar to use it and its better to streamline it with other tests in this plugin.\nI am well aware that this is a quite large changeset however I hope that there is still interest in this PR and it will be reviewed.\nIf there are any questions, please do not hesitate to ping me.\n\n Make sure you are requesting to pull a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your master branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue"

    "description": "Views on the dashboard are selectable at the top of the dashboard in the Views Tab Bar\n\nAn extension point exists that allows to change the way this tab bar is presented. While most plugins that implement that extension point are quite old I recently adopted one such plugin (favorite-view) and made it work with current Jenkins.\nWhich tabbar is used is configured on the system page or on the folder page. Currently what is configured there is the truth and users don't have the possibility to adjust it to their needs.\nA similar extension point exists that allows to configure the Tab bar on the users My Views page but there is no plugin that implements the extension point (MyViewsTabBar class)\nThis change proposes the following:\n\ndeprecate the MyViewsTabBar class (and it's default implementation)\nIntroduce a new user property that makes it possible for a user to override what is configured for the global dashboard or a folder as Views Tab Bar\nInstead of the MyViewsTabBar, a user can select one of the implementations of ViewsTabBar to be used for the My Views dashboard\nthe default view on the My Views configuration is filled with a select instead of checking if the user enters a valid view name.\n\nThere a few plugins that should be adjusted once they consume a Jenkins core version with this change as they refer to the myViewsTabBar (only in jelly/groovy files)\n\ndynamic-search-view\ncategorized-view\nsectioned-view\ndelivery-pipeline\ndashboard-view\nremote-jobs-view (neer published)\n\nUses ViewsTabBar in Java code\n\nnested-view\n\nAll plugins are still working but might not show the viewstabbar that a user has selected\n\nSee JENKINS-XXXXX.\n\nTesting done\nSo far interactive testing only\n\ncreate several views on the main dashboard\nconfigure an alternative ViewsTabBar (favorite-view under Manage -\u003e System\nUnder User preferences select (Inherit from Container)\nThe main dashboard uses the favorite-view tabbar\nUnder User preferences select (Default Views Tabbar)\nThe main dashboard uses the default\ncreate a second user without configuring anything in the user preferences\ndashboard shows favorite-view tabbar\n\n\nProposed changelog entries\n\nAllow to configure the views tab bar per user\n\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label rfe,web-ui\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\n\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query)."

    "description": "Hello m2release developers! üëã\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!"

    "description": "Drop the 2.462.x line\nThe transition to the 2.479.x line is progressing very well.  That is causing the 2.462.x line to become an independent, outdated copy of bom-weekly.\nThere are 1800 lines in bom-weekly and 1500 lines in bom-2.462.x.  New releases of the bom-2.462.x line will have far fewer plugin updates than is typical for the oldest line in the bom.\nRemoving the 2.462.x line may also allow us to successfully complete a full build on ci.jenkins.io.  That is a temporary condition, but it will allow us more time to identify the issues on ci.jenkins.io and resolve them.\nTesting done\nConfirmed that example in contributing file passes:\nPLUGINS=structs,mailer TEST=InjectedTest bash local-test.sh\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue"

This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels.

Serialization for non-doctype declarations no longer end with a\nspurious !. #2275\nWhen converting parsed HTML to XML or the W3C DOM, element names containing \u003c are normalized to _ to ensure valid\nXML. For example, \u003cfoo\u003cbar\u003e becomes \u003cfoo_bar\u003e, as XML does not allow \u003c in element names, but HTML5\ndoes. #2276\nReimplemented the HTML5 Adoption Agency Algorithm to the current spec. This handles mis-nested formating / structural elements. #2278\n\n\n\n... (truncated)\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.19.1 (2025-03-04)\nChanges\n\nAdded support for http/2 requests in Jsoup.connect(), when running on Java 11+, via the Java HttpClient\nimplementation. #2257.\n\nIn this version of jsoup, the default is to make requests via the HttpUrlConnection implementation: use\nSystem.setProperty(\"jsoup.useHttpClient\", \"true\"); to enable making requests via the HttpClient instead ,\nwhich will enable http/2 support, if available. This will become the default in a later version of jsoup, so now is\na good time to validate it.\nIf you are repackaging the jsoup jar in your deployment (i.e. creating a shaded- or a fat-jar), make sure to specify\nthat as a Multi-Release\nJAR.\nIf the HttpClient impl is not available in your JRE, requests will continue to be made via\nHttpURLConnection (in http/1.1 mode).\n\n\nUpdated the minimum Android API Level validation from 10 to 21. As with previous jsoup versions, Android\ndevelopers need to enable core library desugaring. The minimum Java version remains Java 8.\n#2173\nRemoved previously deprecated class: org.jsoup.UncheckedIOException (replace with java.io.UncheckedIOException);\nmoved previously deprecated method Element Element#forEach(Consumer) to\nvoid Element#forEach(Consumer()). #2246\nDeprecated the methods Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(bool) and #Document#updateMetaCharsetElement(), as the\nsetting had no effect. When Document#charset(Charset) is called, the document's meta charset or XML encoding\ninstruction is always set. #2247\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen cleaning HTML with a Safelist that preserves relative links, the isValid() method will now consider these\nlinks valid. Additionally, the enforced attribute rel=nofollow will only be added to external links when configured\nin the safelist. #2245\nAdded Element#selectStream(String query) and Element#selectStream(Evaluator) methods, that return a Stream of\nmatching elements. Elements are evaluated and returned as they are found, and the stream can be\nterminated early. #2092\nElement objects now implement Iterable, enabling them to be used in enhanced for loops.\nAdded support for fragment parsing from a Reader via\nParser#parseFragmentInput(Reader, Element, String). #1177\nReintroduced CLI executable examples, in jsoup-examples.jar. #1702\nOptimized performance of selectors like #id .class (and other similar descendant queries) by around 4.6x, by better\nbalancing the Ancestor evaluator's cost function in the query\nplanner. #2254\nRemoved the legacy parsing rules for \u003cisindex\u003e tags, which would autovivify a form element with labels.

    "description": "The Jenkins project recommends requiring HTTP POSTs on method that have side effects, or can harm the server when hammered, which perfectly makes sense. The security scanner issues warnings for the doFillCredentialsIdItems methods which are used to fill the credential list in the UI.\nI don't expect the code being called to have any side-effect, but I see the community has adopted a mixed-posture for very similar code, oscillating between ignoring the security warning, or switching to POST. Better safe than sorry: requiring a POST is unlikely to cause any problem, let's just do it even if it's not necessary."

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time.

Thanks to G√ºrg√ºn Dayƒ±oƒülu (@‚Äãgurgunday)!\nChanged: All the [formatting rules that were deprecated in ESLint 8.53.0][deprecated-8.53.0] are now excluded if you set the ESLINT_CONFIG_PRETTIER_NO_DEPRECATED environment variable.\n\nVersion 9.0.0 (2023-08-05)\n\nAdded: The CLI helper tool now works with eslint.config.js (flat config). Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the [ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the config of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) ‚Äì it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.\nChanged: [unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add \"unicode-bom\": \"off\" to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with --fix to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM). Thanks to Nicolas Stepien (@‚Äãnstepien)!\n\nVersion 8.10.0 (2023-08-03)\n\nAdded: [max-statements-per-line].

Typically this is because one or more configuration options you are using have been renamed.\nYou don't need to merge this PR right away, because Renovate will continue to migrate these fields internally each time it runs. But later some of these fields may be fully deprecated and the migrations removed. So it's a good idea to merge this migration PR soon.\nüîï Ignore: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about config migration again, but one day your current config may no longer be valid.\n‚ùì Got questions?

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n‚Ä¢ In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n‚Ä¢ Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n‚Ä¢ A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

    "description": "Hello jms-messaging developers! üëã\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!"

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n‚Ä¢ In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n‚Ä¢ Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE.

This will address Issue #375 by permitting authentication with a region that is opted-in in the source AWS account, while accessing ECS clusters in an opt-in region in the target account (which is not opted-in for the source account).\nThe solution was adding an authRegion list-box to choose the region used for IAM authentication, which is stored in an authRegion variable.

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n‚Ä¢ In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n‚Ä¢ Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n‚Ä¢ A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

Thus, MDC would be stuck using the wrong MDCAdapter instance. To fix this issue LoggerFactory and MDC have been modified. Implementations of SLF4JServiceProvider are encouraged to initialize their mdcAdapter and markerFactory fields as early as possible, preferably at construction time. Note that these changes are transparent to existing logging backends which will continue to work as is.\n‚Ä¢ In JDK14LoggerAdapter, fixed extraction of the caller in case there exists an additional logging abstaction such as Jboss logging. This issue was reported in issues/425.\n‚Ä¢ Fixed incorrect interpretation of Level.OFF and Level.ALL in SLF4JPlatformLogger by mapping Level.OFF as Level.ERROR and Level.ALL as Level.TRACE. This issue was reported in issues/430 by Peter Halicky.\n‚Ä¢ A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit c233ea1932228a7fc580823289f896e97ba8a74d associated with the tag v_2.0.17.

To solve this problem, we decide simply remove the module-sync condition, so require(\"prettier\") will still use the CommonJS version, we'll revisit until require(ESM) feature is more stable.\nv3.5.1\nCompare Source\ndiff\nFix CLI crash when cache for old version exists (#‚Äã17100 by @‚Äãsosukesuzuki)\nPrettier 3.5 uses a different cache format than previous versions, Prettier 3.5.0 crashes when reading existing cache file, Prettier 3.5.1 fixed the problem.\nSupport dockercompose and github-actions-workflow in VSCode (#‚Äã17101 by @‚Äãremcohaszing)\nPrettier now supports the dockercompose and github-actions-workflow languages in Visual Studio Code.\nv3.5.0\nCompare Source\ndiff\nüîó Release Notes\n\n\nConfiguration\nüìÖ Schedule: Branch creation - \"* 0-3 * * 1\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\nüö¶ Automerge: Disabled by config.

We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!"

The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!"

This introduced a regression in the case the PR source repository is not the same as the target, for example a person fork. In this case the bitbucket api created from the PR head will point to the fork repo and may result in a 401 error if the credentials don't have the necessary permissions.\nERROR: Could not send notifications\ncom.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.bitbucket.api.BitbucketRequestException: HTTP request error.\nStatus: HTTP/1.1 401\nResponse: {\"errors\":[{\"context\":null,\"message\":\"You are not permitted to access this resource\",\"exceptionName\":\"com.atlassian.bitbucket.AuthorisationException\"}]}\n\nThis change will force the bitbucket api instance to be the target repo which is the appropriate target for the notification. The old api was commit hash centric, not project centric, so the api client owner/repo didn't matter.\nThis change also reverts some changes introduced by #954 to the refName parameter. While local testing has shown that by changing the bitbucket client to point to the target repo, setting the refName to null works in all cases, this change has been restricted to only cases when the source repo is the same as the target.\nNo changes were made to the Bitbucket Cloud code path.\nYour checklist for this pull request\n\n Make sure you are requesting to pull a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your master branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or in Jenkins JIRA\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Did you provide a test-case?

(Issue 981)\n\nFixed\n\nBug in withPrefabValueForField where in some cases the prefab value is not used.\n\n[3.19] - 2025-02-06\nAdded\n\nforPackage(String packageName, ScanOption... option) overload. This provides a more consistent way to fine-tune the scanning of packages. ScanOption provides several features, which can be mixed and matched:\n\nScanOption.recursive() to search recursively. This replaces forPackage(String packageName, boolean scanRecursively).\nScanOption.mustExtend(Class\u003c?\u003e type) to find only classes that extend or implement the given type. This replaces forPackage(String packageName, Class\u003c?\u003e mustExtend). Note that this overload used to search recursively too; this is no longer the case. If you want a recursive search that also only matches subtypes, you have to combine ScanOption.recursive() and ScanOption.mustExtend(Class\u003c?\u003e type).\nScanOption.except(Class\u003c?\u003e... types) to find all classes except the given ones. This replaces forPackage(...).except(Class\u003c?\u003e... types).\nScanOption.except(Predicate\u003cClass\u003c?\u003e\u003e exclusionPredicate) to exclude all classes that match the given predicate. This replaces forPackage(...).except(Predicate\u003cClass\u003c?\u003e\u003e exclusionPredicate).\nScanOption.ignoreExternalJars() to not throw an exception when attempting to scan a package from a third-party jar file. This can be useful if you have a split package between a dependency and your own codebase. This is a new option. (Issue 1040)\n\n\n\nDeprecated\n\nforPackage(String packageName, boolean scanRecursively): replaced by ScanOption.recursive().\nforPackage(String packageName, Class\u003c?\u003e mustExtend): replaced by ScanOption.mustExtend(Class\u003c?\u003e type) combined with ScanOption.recursive().\nforPackage(...).except(Class\u003c?\u003e... types): replaced by ScanOption.except(Class\u003c?\u003e... type).\nforPackage(...).except(Predicate\u003cClass\u003c?\u003e\u003e... exclusionPredicate): replaced by ScanOption.except(Predicate\u003cClass\u003c?\u003e\u003e exclusionPredicate).\n\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n19afe30 Bumps version to 3.19.1\n24a6cc8 Updates CHANGELOG for release\necd7cf4 Adds prefab value for ReentrantLock\nac3b739 Merge pull request #1049 from jqno/dependabot/maven/dependencies-d55d503729\n628b68f Bump the dependencies group with 3 updates\n9d534a8 Adds test for JakartaLazyEntity\n5c7aedc Merge pull request #1048 from jqno/prefabvalue-for-field-not-applied\n487f767 Replaces ValueProvider with SubjectCreator in JpaLazyGetterFieldCheck\n1034aac SubjectCreator is more appropriate than ValueProvider here\n9842362 Removes caching from SubjectCreator, because that's now handled by the ValueP...\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

The previous approach of obtaining the secret via jnlpUrl was removed in PR 8773 and PR 677.\nCurrently, only administrators can retrieve the secret via a script, which makes it difficult for users with Agent Create or Agent Connect permissions to authenticate when using WebSockets.\nThis PR solves the issue by introducing an API that allows users with the required permissions to programmatically obtain the agent secret via a REST endpoint.\nTesting done\nAutomated Tests:\nAdded unit tests for the new API to validate security restrictions and ensure only authorized users can access the secret.\nManual Testing:\nVerified that a user with Agent Connect permission could retrieve the secret using the API.\nTested API endpoint using curl and Postman\nProposed changelog entries\n\nAdd a REST API to retrieve the secret required for agents.\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label rfe\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query)."

    "description": "Hello 42crunch-security-audit developers! üëã\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!"

The Tests for the same also have been provided in OpenIdSessionTest.java.\nHere's a simple explanation of what these tests do:\nWhat's being tested:\nThese tests verify the OpenID login process, specifically the doCommenceLogin functionality\nThey're testing session handling during login attempts\nTwo main test scenarios:\n// Test 1: When there's no request\npublic void testDoCommenceLoginWithNullRequest() {\n// Checks if login works when there's no request\n// Makes sure nothing breaks when there's no session to invalidate\n}\n// Test 2: When there's a valid request\npublic void testDoCommenceLoginWithValidRequest() {\n// Checks if login works with a normal request\n// Verifies that the old session gets properly invalidated\n// Confirms a new session ID is generated\n}\nHow they work:\nUses mock objects to simulate web requests and sessions\nCreates a special test version of OpenIdSession that can be controlled\nVerifies that:\nLogin process doesn't fail\nSessions are handled correctly\nOld sessions are properly invalidated when needed\nIn essence, these tests make sure the OpenID login process works correctly and securely by properly managing user sessions, both when there's a request and when there isn't one.\nI am also attaching the successful run for the test class as a proof of its working.\n\nPlease let me know if any other clarification needed."

The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.479 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.479.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.479.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!\nSupersedes #3 ."

See https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html for the documentation on the Jira side.\nThere are automated tests in SingningInterceptorTest.\nThis can be tested manually by adding a Personal Access Token on a Jira instance, and add that as a String Credential in Jenkins. Then add a new site in the settings of jira-steps-plugin for that Jira instance, and choose Credentials as login type, and pick the new credential in the drop-down.
