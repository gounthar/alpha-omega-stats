    "description": "This is an attempt to enhance the Support Bundle Generation view. The improvements introduced are:\nMoving the list of options from the main page to a pop-up/widget.\nUsers don't always need to mark or unmark any options if they just want to generate a default support bundle. Moving the list to a pop-up or widget allows us to add more elements to manage the checked options in the main view (see next improvement sections).\nTo open the widget we will need to click on Select options:\n\nThe new widget shows the following:\n\nPlease pay attention to the code displayed in the bottom-right corner. This is a HASH generated from the current selected (checked) options. Please refer to the \"Custom options\" section for more information about this new element.\nYou can close the widget by clicking on Close or pressing the Esc key.\nChoose a general set of options\nSelecting which options should be checked can be complex for standards users, so it may be a good idea to have a dropdown element with some standard options (such as configuration files, performance, etc.). For the moment, only three options were added (default, default + configuration files, and performance). As soon as the user clicks or selects one general option in this dropdown, the options will be checked in the widget (by JS).\n\nCustom options\nThis could be the most interesting part of this development.\nEach option will have an ID in the list of options. Anytime that a user check or uncheck any option in the widget a HASH value will be calculated in base on the current selected options. This HASH will appear in two locations: in the bottom-right corner of the widget, and in the input textbox under the Choose a general set of options.\n\nSelecting the Custom value in the Choose a general set of options dropdown, the textbox for the custom value will appear. If you type a HASH value in this textbox and press the Enter key (or click in the Apply button), the options in the widget will be selected according to this HASH value. After that, we could optionally click on Select options and alter this set of select options.\nThere is an issue with plugins that extend the Component class. The elements shown in the widget (and originally on that page) are classes that extend the Component class and satisfy some requirements. Those classes can be provided by any plugin (not only the support-core-plugin). This question makes the management of this HASH so hard (since we cannot ensure that all the child components will implement the getHash method (inherited from the Component class). Therefore, the decision was made to disregard the child components that would not correctly implement the getHash method. By doing that, we can share a HASH code that we can ensure will work.\nTesting done\nThe development was tested in three different ways:\n\nA Junit test was created for the getHash method of the child components.\nThe plugin was deployed in Jenkins version 2.479.3 and passed the basic integration tests:\n\nSelecting all the general options and confirming that the options were checked correctly in the widget.\nSelecting the Custom general options and confirming that the correct options were checked with different known HASH codes.\nChecking and unckecking different options in the widget and confirming that the generated HASH was correct.\nConfirming the usage of events (like the Esc for the widget or the Enter for the custom textbox).\nGenerating a support bundle and confirming that the options checked in the widget were included in the file.\n\n\n\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure. To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.\n\nWe as plugin developers should try our best to support this. One way of doing so is to enable the Jenkins Security Scan on this repository. For more details see the documentation.\nThis PR may create new issues in the Code scanning section of this project once it is merged. I'd be happy to try and help resolve those if necessary.\nPlease note this PR was created semi-automatically.

    "description": "Hello safe-batch-environment-filter developers! 👋\nThis is an automated pull request created by the Jenkins Plugin Modernizer tool. The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.504.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.504.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

It also brings performance gains in DOM manipulation and fragment parsing, and fixes several edge cases in stream parsing, traversal, cloning, and concurrent reads.\njsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML and XML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.\nChanges\n\nDeprecated internal (yet visible) methods Normalizer#normalize(String, bool) and Attribute#shouldCollapseAttribute(Document.OutputSettings). These will be removed in a future version.\nDeprecated Connection#sslSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory) in favor of the new Connection#sslContext(SSLContext). Using sslSocketFactory will force the use of the legacy HttpUrlConnection implementation, which does not support HTTP/2. #2370\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen pretty-printing, if there are consecutive text nodes (via DOM manipulation), the non-significant whitespace between them will be collapsed. #2349.\nUpdated Connection.Response#statusMessage() to return a simple loggable string message (e.g. \"OK\") when using the HttpClient implementation, which doesn't otherwise return any server-set status message. #2356\nAttributes#size() and Attributes#isEmpty() now exclude any internal attributes (such as user data) from their count. This aligns with the attributes' serialized output and iterator. #2369\nAdded Connection#sslContext(SSLContext) to provide a custom SSL (TLS) context to requests, supporting both the HttpClient and the legacy HttUrlConnection implementations. #2370\nPerformance optimizations for DOM manipulation methods including when repeatedly removing an element's first child (element.child(0).remove(), and when using Parser#parseBodyFragement() to parse a large number of direct children. #2373.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nWhen parsing from an InputStream and a multibyte character happened to straddle a buffer boundary, the stream would not be completely read. #2353.\nIn NodeTraversor, if a last child element was removed during the head() call, the parent would be visited twice. #2355.\nCloning an Element that has an Attributes object would add an empty internal user-data attribute to that clone, which would cause unexpected results for Attributes#size() and Attributes#isEmpty(). #2356\nIn a multithreaded application where multiple threads are calling Element#children() on the same element concurrently, a race condition could happen when the method was generating the internal child element cache (a filtered view of its child nodes). Since concurrent reads of DOM objects should be threadsafe without external synchronization, this method has been updated to execute atomically. #2366\nMalformed HTML could throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException during the adoption agency. #2377.\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.21.2 (2025-Aug-25)\nChanges\n\nDeprecated internal (yet visible) methods Normalizer#normalize(String, bool) and Attribute#shouldCollapseAttribute(Document.OutputSettings).

    "description": "Bumps org.jsoup:jsoup from 1.21.1 to 1.21.2.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's releases.\n\njsoup 1.21.2\njsoup 1.21.2 is out now, adding support for custom SSLContext in HTTP/2 connections, and improving consistency in how user data is handled in attributes. It also brings performance gains in DOM manipulation and fragment parsing, and fixes several edge cases in stream parsing, traversal, cloning, and concurrent reads.\njsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML and XML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.\nChanges\n\nDeprecated internal (yet visible) methods Normalizer#normalize(String, bool) and Attribute#shouldCollapseAttribute(Document.OutputSettings). These will be removed in a future version.\nDeprecated Connection#sslSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory) in favor of the new Connection#sslContext(SSLContext). Using sslSocketFactory will force the use of the legacy HttpUrlConnection implementation, which does not support HTTP/2. #2370\n\nImprovements\n\nWhen pretty-printing, if there are consecutive text nodes (via DOM manipulation), the non-significant whitespace between them will be collapsed. #2349.\nUpdated Connection.Response#statusMessage() to return a simple loggable string message (e.g. \"OK\") when using the HttpClient implementation, which doesn't otherwise return any server-set status message. #2356\nAttributes#size() and Attributes#isEmpty() now exclude any internal attributes (such as user data) from their count. This aligns with the attributes' serialized output and iterator. #2369\nAdded Connection#sslContext(SSLContext) to provide a custom SSL (TLS) context to requests, supporting both the HttpClient and the legacy HttUrlConnection implementations. #2370\nPerformance optimizations for DOM manipulation methods including when repeatedly removing an element's first child (element.child(0).remove(), and when using Parser#parseBodyFragement() to parse a large number of direct children. #2373.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nWhen parsing from an InputStream and a multibyte character happened to straddle a buffer boundary, the stream would not be completely read. #2353.\nIn NodeTraversor, if a last child element was removed during the head() call, the parent would be visited twice. #2355.\nCloning an Element that has an Attributes object would add an empty internal user-data attribute to that clone, which would cause unexpected results for Attributes#size() and Attributes#isEmpty(). #2356\nIn a multithreaded application where multiple threads are calling Element#children() on the same element concurrently, a race condition could happen when the method was generating the internal child element cache (a filtered view of its child nodes). Since concurrent reads of DOM objects should be threadsafe without external synchronization, this method has been updated to execute atomically. #2366\nMalformed HTML could throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException during the adoption agency. #2377.\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog.\n\n1.21.2 (2025-Aug-25)\nChanges\n\nDeprecated internal (yet visible) methods Normalizer#normalize(String, bool) and Attribute#shouldCollapseAttribute(Document.OutputSettings).

    "description": "Bumps org.jsoup:jsoup from 1.21.1 to 1.21.2.\n\nRelease notes\nSourced from org.jsoup:jsoup's releases.\n\njsoup 1.21.2\njsoup 1.21.2 is out now, adding support for custom SSLContext in HTTP/2 connections, and improving consistency in how user data is handled in attributes. It also brings performance gains in DOM manipulation and fragment parsing, and fixes several edge cases in stream parsing, traversal, cloning, and concurrent reads.\njsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML and XML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.\nChanges\n\nDeprecated internal (yet visible) methods Normalizer#normalize(String, bool) and Attribute#shouldCollapseAttribute(Document.OutputSettings).

The tool has applied the following recipes to modernize the plugin:\n\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17\n    io.jenkins.tools.pluginmodernizer.UpgradeNextMajorParentVersion\n    Upgrade to the next major parent version (5.X) requiring Jenkins 2.492 and Java 17.\n\nWhy Upgrade to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.504.x?\n\n\nEmbrace Java 17 LTS Stability: Benefit from long-term support with modern language features that improve development practice and plugin performance.\n\n\nHarness Jenkins 2.504.x Innovations: Stay aligned with the latest features and stability improvements, ensuring smooth integration and future-proofing.\n\n\nEnhance Security: Protect your plugin with up-to-date security fixes from both Java 17 and Jenkins core improvements.\n\n\nAlign with the Community: Keep pace with ecosystem shifts towards Java 17, ensuring compatibility and expanding your plugin's user base.\n\n\nEnjoy a Better Developer Experience: Make the most of advanced tooling support and simplified dependency management with Java 17's enhancements.\n\n\nRemoving developers Tag from pom.xml\nJenkins no longer requires the developers tag in pom.xml, as the developers section was traditionally used to list individuals responsible for the plugin.\nInstead, Jenkins now uses the Repository Permission Updater (RPU) to manage permissions and developer information.\nBenefits of Removing developers Tag:\n\nSimplification: Removes unnecessary metadata from the pom.xml, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable file.\nConsistency: Centralizes developer information management through the RPU, minimizing discrepancies.\nSecurity: Utilizes the RPU's controlled permission management, enhancing the security of artifact deployments.\n\nRemoving the developers tag aligns with modern Jenkins infrastructure standards and prevents outdated or redundant developer information from being included in plugin metadata.\nJEP-227: Replace Acegi Security with Spring Security\nMigrating Jenkins plugin code from Acegi Security to Spring Security is important for several reasons:\n\nSecurity updates: Spring Security is the modern, actively maintained successor to Acegi Security, providing up-to-date security features and patches.\nCompatibility: Jenkins core version 2.266 and later have replaced Acegi Security with Spring Security, so plugins need to be updated to remain compatible with newer Jenkins versions.\nEliminating false positives: Security scanners often flag the outdated Acegi Security library as vulnerable, causing unnecessary concerns and exemption requests in security-conscious organizations.\nReducing technical debt: The Acegi Security code in Jenkins was written over 13 years ago and has barely been touched since, making it difficult to maintain and understand.\nAccess to modern features: Spring Security offers more current security implementations and features that weren't available in Acegi Security.\nCommunity support: With the Jenkins ecosystem moving to Spring Security, plugins using the newer library will benefit from better community support and compatibility with other plugins.\nSimplified API: The migration offers an opportunity to introduce a new simplified security API in Jenkins, potentially making it easier for plugin developers to work with security-related functions.\n\nBy migrating to Spring Security, plugin developers ensure their code remains compatible with current Jenkins versions, benefit from modern security features, and contribute to a more secure and maintainable Jenkins ecosystem.\nSummary\nBy upgrading, you'll be positioning your plugin at the forefront of performance, security, and user satisfaction. We encourage you to explore these updates and provide feedback. Let's continue to build a robust Jenkins ecosystem together!",

    "description": "This PR enables strict checking of bundled artifacts. The motivation is described in jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin#557. This should help prevent accidental library bundling when adding and updating dependencies.\nAlso, when enabling strict bundled artifact checks for opentelemetry, I noticed that this plugin was providing an optional compile-scope dependency path to jsr305, which we try to avoid in the Jenkins ecosystem. See for example jenkinsci/jenkins#4604 and the many linked PRs. Excluding the dependency here prevents downstream plugins from inadvertently using jsr305.\nTesting done\nmvn verify passes with the new flags\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

E.g. in the case of secrets/credentials being managed in a third party system such as Vault, and the not being available for some reason (system outage, config error, network problems, etc).\nTesting done\nCreated a private build of the change and deployed it to a Vault - Jenkins - Elastic setup and added a system logger for hudson.plugins.audit_trail.ElasticSearchAuditLogger to observe more details.\n\nVerified that data is logged in the normal case\nChanged the Vault hostname to something incorrect and restarted Jenkins\nVerified that the config was not treated as unreadable\nVerified that configured Elast Logger values in system settings were shown\nCorrected Vault hostname\nObserved that the Audit Trail plugin preserved it's settings, recovered and started logging\nRepeated the procedure above with incorrect port in the Vault setting and incorrect Vault credentials\nAlso tested removing the credential id in the Jenkins credential store. No regression compared to current release ion this case.  (But this is handled somewhere else than ElasticSearchAuditLogger, so it does not show up in the log below)\n\nSee log data for details:\nCapturedLoginfo.txt\nPerhaps a general \"catch all exception types\" is not a good solution, but as can be seen in the log excerpt, several different exceptions can occur.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",

Since the transition, the test fails much more frequently.  The failures are not pointing to a real problem, but a change in the infrastructure.\nInfra help desk issue that is investigating:\n\njenkins-infra/helpdesk#4730\n\nLet's not waste time or resources retrying this test on Windows in CI.\nLaunchable flakiness report\n\nTesting done\n\nRan JenkinsTest#runScriptOnOfflineComputer on 5 different Windows computers before making this change.  Execution times ranged from 21 sec to 45 sec (depending on the age of the Windows computer).  None of those tests failed.\nConfirmed that the test is skipped on those Windows computers after making this change\n\nThose Windows computers are running a mix of Windows 10 and Windows 11 with local SSD disc drives.  They each have at least 16 GB of RAM.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nN/A\n\nProposed changelog category\n/label skip-changelog\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.\n The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see examples). Fill in the Proposed upgrade guidelines section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.\n There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.\n New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with @Restricted or have @since TODO Javadocs, as appropriate.\n New deprecations are annotated with @Deprecated(since = \"TODO\") or @Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = \"TODO\"), if applicable.\n New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call eval to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see documentation).\n For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.\n For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.\n\nDesired reviewers\nN/A\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\nMaintainer checklist\n\n There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.\n Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.\n Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or Proposed changelog entries are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the pull request title (see example).\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).",

    "description": "This commit adds support for excel and excelMulti reports.\nIt introduces a new Tabular abstract class to share code between the CSV, excel and excelMulti providers.\nThe excel and excelMulti providers use Apache POI to parse excel files.\nThe TabularParser has been modified to use the cell type to identify numeric values.\nI was unable to get the tests to pass. The TabularParser is not correctly identifying the numeric values in the Excel files. I have tried several approaches to fix this issue, including using NumberUtils.isCreatable, regular expressions, and NumberUtils.isParsable. None of these approaches have worked. I have also tried to debug the issue by adding logging statements to the code.\nMy last attempt was to use the cell type to identify numeric values. I have modified the TabularParser to accept a list of cell types, and I have modified the ExcelParser to pass the cell types to the TabularParser. However, this has resulted in a compilation error. I have fixed the compilation error, but the tests are still failing.\n\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests that demonstrate the feature works or the issue is fixed",
