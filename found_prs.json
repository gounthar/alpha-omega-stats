    "description": "JENKINS-74055\nThe current functionality is broken:\n\nThe code isn’t triggered in the pipeline view, likely intentional, as the file isn’t included in the sources. The code is supposed to toggle build details/actions for each card when clicking the header (Project Build #), but instead, it redirects users to the build status page.\nThe code isn’t compatible with the jQuery 3 update #140.\n\nI moved the script to BuildPipelineView/bpp.jelly to execute it within the pipeline view. After making it compatible with jQuery 3, the toggling behavior now conflicts with the existing redirection to the build status page.\n\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003e\n        // show/hide build details\n        jQuery(function() {\n            jQuery(\".header\").click(function() {\n                var parent = jQuery(this).parent();\n                var ba = parent.find(\".build-actions\");\n                var bb = parent.find(\".build-body\");\n\n                ba.add(bb).toggle('slow');\n            });\n        });\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\nShow/Hide Behavior Demonstration - Video\nAfter extracting JS - I tested by adding adjunct in BuildPipelineView/bpp.jelly and confirmed it still works.\n@basil @yaroslavafenkin - what do you think is the best approach here? Would it be better to remove the script completely?\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

Sternberg\nAkihiro Suda\nGuillaume Lours\nLaurent Goderre\nSebastiaan van Stijn\n\nNotable Changes\n\nBake command now requires passing filesystem entitlements with --allow when your build needs to read or write files outside of your current working directory. This feature currently only reports a warning when using local Bake definition, but will start to produce an error starting from the v0.20 release. If you wish to enable the error in the current release, you can set BUILDX_BAKE_ENTITLEMENTS_FS=1 #​2796 #​2812\nBake definition now supports new object notation for the fields that previously required CSV strings as inputs (output, cache-from, cache-to, secret, ssh) #​2758\nBake definition now allows defining validation conditions to variables #​2794\nCompose support has been updated to v2.4.4 #​2806 #​2780\nMetadata file values can now contain JSON array values #​2777\nImprove error messages when using an incorrect format for labels #​2778\nFreeBSD and OpenBSD artifacts are now included in release #​2774 #​2775 #​2781\nFix printing bake definition with empty Compose networks #​2790\n\nDependency Changes\n\ngithub.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4                                   v4.2.1 -\u003e v4.3.0\ngithub.com/compose-spec/compose-go/v2                            v2.4.1 -\u003e v2.4.4\ngithub.com/containerd/containerd                                 v1.7.22 -\u003e v1.7.24\ngithub.com/containerd/continuity                                 v0.4.4 -\u003e v0.4.5\ngithub.com/containerd/errdefs                                    v0.1.0 -\u003e v0.3.0\ngithub.com/containerd/typeurl/v2                                 v2.2.0 -\u003e v2.2.3\ngithub.com/docker/cli                                            v27.3.1 -\u003e v27.4.0-rc.2\ngithub.com/docker/docker                                         v27.3.1 -\u003e v27.4.0-rc.2\ngithub.com/go-logr/logr                                          v1.4.1 -\u003e v1.4.2\ngithub.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2                        v2.16.0 -\u003e v2.20.0\ngithub.com/moby/buildkit                                         v0.17.0 -\u003e v0.18.0\ngithub.com/prometheus/client_golang                              v1.17.0 -\u003e v1.20.2\ngithub.com/prometheus/client_model                               v0.5.0 -\u003e v0.6.1\ngithub.com/prometheus/common                                     v0.44.0 -\u003e v0.55.0\ngithub.com/tonistiigi/fsutil                                     397af53 -\u003e 31cf1f4\ngo.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp    v0.46.1 -\u003e v0.53.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel                                         v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace                v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc  v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp  v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric                                  v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk                                     v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric                              v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace                                   v1.21.0 -\u003e v1.28.0\ngo.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp                                   v1.0.0 -\u003e v1.3.1\ngoogle.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/api                        ef581f9 -\u003e f6361c8\ngoogle.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc                        ef581f9 -\u003e f6361c8\ngoogle.golang.org/grpc                                           v1.66.2 -\u003e v1.66.3\n\nPrevious release can be found at v0.18.0\nv0.18.0\nCompare Source\nWelcome to the v0.18.0 release of buildx!\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\nhttps://github.com/docker/buildx/issues.\nContributors\n\nCrazyMax\nTõnis Tiigi\nJonathan A.

The fix involves:\n\nReplacing plain text storage of Zoom integrity tokens with Jenkins Secret encryption\nEnhancing overall plugin security to prevent potential Zoom account takeovers\n\nThis change significantly improves data security by encrypting sensitive information and protecting users from unauthorized access to their Zoom accounts.\nImportant: Old plain text configurations will be overwritten with the new secure storage method when users resave their jobs.\nTesting done:\n\nVerified the new Secret storage mechanism correctly encrypts and decrypts Zoom tokens\nTested plugin functionality integrity after implementing the new storage method\nConducted manual tests to ensure smooth migration from old configurations to the new secure storage\nVerified that old plain text configurations are successfully overwritten when jobs are resaved\n\nRelated issues:\nhttps://issues.jenkins.io/browse/SECURITY-3292",

    "description": "This PR addresses the issues regarding slashes in branch and tag names.\nThe root issue is that the Bitbucket API does not handle double encoded slashes correctly / does not support slashed branch \u0026 tag names.\nWe have had to move to the query parameter API as tomcat hard rejects non double encoded slashes. This means the expected JSON that has been returned is now different and has an array of values sent back by the API. We have captured this in BitbucketPropertyValue.Java.\nOld API: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/rest/v902/api-group-repository/#api-api-latest-projects-projectkey-repos-repositoryslug-commits-commitid-get\nNew API: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/rest/v902/api-group-repository/#api-api-latest-projects-projectkey-repos-repositoryslug-commits-get\nTesting done\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

We consider the issues low-priority, so even if you see automated scanners saying otherwise, don't be scared.\n4.0.4\n\nfix: Update picomatch to fix regression #179 (8becb55)\n\n4.0.3\n\nEnforce newer version of picomatch with bugfixes\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\nSourced from micromatch's changelog.\n\n[4.0.8] - 2024-08-22\n\nbackported CVE-2024-4067 fix (from v4.0.6) over to 4.x branch\n\n[4.0.7] - 2024-05-22\n\nthis is basically v4.0.5, with some README updates\nit is vulnerable to CVE-2024-4067\nUpdated braces to v3.0.3 to avoid CVE-2024-4068\ndoes NOT break API compatibility\n\n[4.0.6] - 2024-05-21\n\nAdded hasBraces to check if a pattern contains braces.\nFixes CVE-2024-4067\nBREAKS API COMPATIBILITY\nShould be labeled as a major release, but it's not.\n\n[4.0.1 - 4.0.5]\n[4.0.0] - 2019-03-20\nAdded\n\nAdds support for options.onMatch. See the readme for details\nAdds support for options.onIgnore. See the readme for details\nAdds support for options.onResult. See the readme for details\n\nBreaking changes\n\nRequire Node.js \u003e= 8.6\nRemoved support for passing an array of brace patterns to micromatch.braces().\nTo strictly enforce closing brackets (for {, [, and (), you must now use strictBrackets=true instead of strictErrors.\ncache - caching and all related options and methods have been removed\noptions.unixify was renamed to options.windows\noptions.nodupes Was removed. Duplicates are always removed by default. You can override this with custom behavior by using the onMatch, onResult and onIgnore functions.\noptions.snapdragon was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used.\noptions.sourcemap was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used, which provided sourcemap support.\n\n[3.0.0] - 2017-04-11\nComplete overhaul, with 36,000+ new unit tests validated against actual output generated by Bash and minimatch. More specifically, 35,000+ of the tests:\n\nmicromatch results are directly compared to bash results\nin rare cases, when micromatch and bash disagree, micromatch's results are compared to minimatch's results\nmicromatch is much more accurate than minimatch, so there were cases where I had to make assumptions. I'll try to document these.\n\nThis refactor introduces a parser and compiler that are supersets of more granular parsers and compilers from other sub-modules. Each of these sub-modules has a singular responsibility and focuses on a certain type of matching that aligns with a specific part of the Bash \"expansion\" API.\nThese sub-modules work like plugins to seamlessly create the micromatch parser/compiler, so that strings are parsed in one pass, an AST is created, then a new string is generated by the compiler.\n\n\n...

    "description": "While updating some plugin code to take advantage of Java 17 records, I noticed that one major use case for a static final class with all final fields was MasterToSlaveCallables. Unfortunately these cannot be converted to record since that cannot extend another class. I thought it would be nicer to introduce a similar interface (with updated naming, while we are here!) that is friendlier to records.\nI picked RemoteLaunchCallable as an example of substantial legibility improvements from this conversion, but could try doing more as well. (OpenRewrite would be great though I am not experienced in that yet.)\nSimilarly, MasterToSlaveFileCallable was unnecessarily awkward to use; FilePath.Archive can be simplified this way as an example.\nTesting done\nNone, just presuming that RemoteLaunchCallable and FilePath.Archive are well covered by existing functional tests.\nNote that the version of SpotBugs we are currently running suffers from spotbugs/spotbugs#2795 which is relevant for this use case: these records are Serializable (transiently), but no serialVersionUID is meaningful since Java serialization for records is handled specially.

    "description": "https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-74018\n\nRemoved checkUrl attribute from the affected fields and renamed the parameter names in validation methods to let CheckMethod do all the work.\nReplaced poj:textarea with f:textarea. poj:textarea is provided by https://plugins.jenkins.io/publish-over/ which had it's last release 7 years ago. It doesn't have some of the attributes that modern f:textarea has, and also stands out visually from the rest of the fields. This change is probably not needed for the form validation to work properly without checkUrl attribute, I haven't checked. Let me know if I should revert this to keep the PR clean.\n\nTesting done\nConfigure an SSH server on the Global Configuration page. Create a new freestyle job, in the Environment section check \"Send files or execute commands over SSH before the build starts\". In Transfer Set section fill Source files and Exec command fields to trigger the affected validation methods.\nBefore the change\nAfter the change\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

Future versions of Error Prone will upgrade back to protobuf 4.x.\nFull changelog: google/error-prone@v2.35.0...v2.35.1\nError Prone  2.35.0\nChanges:\n\nFix handling of \\s before the trailing delimiter in MisleadingEscapedSpace\nTimeUnitMismatch improvements: handle binary trees, consider trees like fooSeconds * 1000 to have units of millis\n\nNew checks:\n\nJavaDurationGetSecondsToToSeconds: Prefer duration.toSeconds() over duration.getSeconds()\n\nFull changelog: google/error-prone@v2.34.0...v2.35.0\nError Prone 2.34.0\nChanges:\n\nPassing the javac flag --should-stop=ifError=FLOW is now required when running Error Prone (#4595)\nThe MemberName check was renamed to IdentifierName\n\nNew checks:\n\nFutureTransformAsync: The usage of transformAsync is not necessary when all the return values of the transformation function are immediate futures.\nMisformattedTestData: Reformats Java source code inside Error Prone test cases.\nMisleadingEscapedSpace: Using \\s anywhere except at the end of a line in a text block is potentially misleading.\nThrowIfUncheckedKnownUnchecked: throwIfUnchecked(knownUnchecked) is equivalent to throw knownUnchecked.\n\nClosed issues: #4595, #4598, #4620\nFull changelog: google/error-prone@v2.33.0...v2.34.0\nError Prone 2.33.0\nSimilar to release 2.32.0, the minimum supported JDK version to run Error Prone is JDK 17 (#3803). Using Error Prone to compile code that is deployed to earlier versions is still fully supported, but will require using JDK 17 or newer for compilation and setting --release or -source/-target/-bootclasspath.\nChanges:\n\nUpdate protobuf version for CVE-2024-7254\n\nNew checks:\n\nArrayRecordComponent: Record components should not be arrays.\n\nFull changelog: google/error-prone@v2.32.0...v2.33.0\n\n\n\nCommits\n\n0e06cc2 Release Error Prone 2.35.1\ndb6c890 Downgrade protobuf version to 3.25.5\ned6b121 Add a repro test for broken behavior inlining the parameter value into the fu...\na931fa3 Remove DoNotUseRuleChain from JavaCodeClarity.\nec2983b compileUnsafe -\u003e compile for compile-time-constant expressions.\n2ce9632 Strip the quotation marks from the source code when reconstructing the literal.\n99a0d9d TimeUnitMismatch: handle BinaryTrees.\n60c5f76 TimeUnitMismatch: consider trees like fooSeconds * 1000 to have units of `m...\n427b51d GetSeconds to ToSeconds error prone\n82a2168 Recognize that Runtime.halt and exit never return.\nAdditional commits viewable in compare view\n\n\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself. You can also trigger a rebase manually by commenting @dependabot rebase.\n\n\nDependabot commands and options\n\nYou can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR:\n\n@dependabot rebase will rebase this PR\n@dependabot recreate will recreate this PR, overwriting any edits that have been made to it\n@dependabot merge will merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n@dependabot squash and merge will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n@dependabot cancel merge will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging\n@dependabot reopen will reopen this PR if it is closed\n@dependabot close will close this PR and stop Dependabot recreating it.

See \"What's new\" below. ✍️🤖\nBehaviour changes\n\nAction input git-token has been renamed branch-token, to be more clear about its purpose. The branch-token is the token that the action will use to create and update the branch.\nThe action now handles requests that have been rate-limited by GitHub. Requests hitting a primary rate limit will retry twice, for a total of three attempts. Requests hitting a secondary rate limit will not be retried.\nThe pull-request-operation output now returns none when no operation was executed.\nRemoved deprecated output environment variable PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER. Please use the pull-request-number action output instead.\n\nWhat's new\n\nThe action can now sign commits as github-actions[bot] when using GITHUB_TOKEN, or your own bot when using GitHub App tokens. See commit signing for details.\nAction input draft now accepts a new value always-true.

Other jobs have Copy artifacts from another project step with src being the project name to copy artifacts from.\nIn security configuration I've enabled project based matrix auth strategy (from matrix-auth). I've added a user that has Item.READ and Item.BUILD permissions. For the src project that archives the artifact I've taken that permission away by enabling project-based security and setting \"Do not inherit...\". I've built all the jobs at least once, starting from the src.\nAfter that I've upgraded the plugin to the latest version.

    "description": "This PR does a few cleanup tasks:\n\nRemoves the Dependabot pull request limit. After this, I plan to see what gets opened and exclude whatever we can't update right away (easily) to see what we can. That way, we can get updates for things that are easily updatable. Right now, we can't, because the things that aren't easily updatable consume the entire open PR limit.\nRemoves the stale GitHub Action, which wasn't being updated anyway.\nUpdates .gitignore with the latest version from the archetype. Anything that gets us closer to the archetype is a benefit for maintainability, as it effectively decreases the amount of custom code that needs to be maintained.\nReverts recent updates to plexus-classworlds and plexus-component-annotations to minimize risk for the next release. I want to ship the next release with the same Maven dependencies as the current release. They can possibly be upgraded in the future, but that requires much more testing I think. I did retain the JSoup upgrade since that seemed safe.\n\nTesting done\nmvn clean verify -Dtest=InjectedTest\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "Use httpclient 5.3.1, not httpclient 5.4\nReverts 1991154 from\n\n#57\n\nThe failure that Docker plugin users encounter with httpclient 5.4 when connecting to the Docker daemon over a Unix domain socket is described in:\n\njenkinsci/docker-plugin#1032\n\nThe test automation failure that happens with httpclient 5.4 is described in:\n\njenkinsci/docker-plugin#1103\n\nTwo other issues note that there are problems in httpclient 5.4:\n\n#29\n#59\n\nIntentionally sets the plugin version to 5.4 so that a release based on this change will supersede the previous 5.4 based release that users may have installed.\nIntentionally disables renovate updates to 5.4 or newer.  Once the issue is resolved in upstream, that block can be removed.\nTesting done\nAutomated tests pass for this plugin.\nAutomated tests pass for the docker plugin with the incremental from this pull request.  Automated tests fail in the docker plugin with the httpclient 5.4 version.\nIncremental build  tested in my development environment with a Docker daemon accessible over a TCP socket.  Confirmed that the switch back to httpclient 5.3.1 did not regress existing functionality over a TCP socket.\nIncremental build tested in a separate environment and confirmed that I can duplicate the problem using the httpclient 5.4 release and the httpclient incremental build from this pull request fixes the issue.  The git repository that I used to record the passing and failing configuration is included as httpclient-59.tar.gz.  The username in that installation is \"mwaite\" and the password is \"mwaite\".  Run the environment with the command bash ./README on a Linux computer with a local Docker daemon.  Be sure that you are running from a user account that has access to Docker.\nDependent plugins include:\n\nSAML depends on 5.4-118.v199115451c4d\nAnalysis model API depends on 5.3.1-110.v77252fb_d4da_5 - no issue\nDocker API depends on 5.2.1-1.0 - no issue\n\nConfirmed that the most recent release of the SAML plugin has a dependency on release\n5.4-120.v6b_5b_322da_5c4.  That release requires Jenkins 2.479 or newer.  I did not find any changes in that release that depend on httpclient 5.4 features.  The downgrade from httpclient 5.4 to httpclient 5.3.1 seems safe for that plugin\nThe previous release (4.487.v9f1c3328f1c0) of the SAML plugin depends on 5.3.1-110.v77252fb_d4da_5 so has no issue with this proposed change.\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

    "description": "I ran into a case where a CloudBees CI customer was missing a proprietary agent protocol (see #8621). It seems that this was quite inadvertent: they had in the past exported a JCasC bundle that included something like\njenkins:\n  agentProtocols:\n  - Ping\n  - JNLP4-connect\ndespite never having touched this configuration section, and without paying attention to this line had committed it to SCM, where it prevented new protocols from appearing! (You can find lots of similar examples, some outdated, by searching.)\nThe history here is long and tortured (#2010, #2950, #3188, #4387, #7451, etc.) but essentially there was a period of Jenkins development in which new TCP (agent) protocols were being actively developed, and a rather complex opt-in-and-out system was devised to allow administrators to pick which protocol(s) to allow and have that choice be partially preserved across upgrades. But for years now, there has only been JNLP4-connect, and there is no meaningful choice: if you do not wish to allow inbound TCP agents, just disable the port.\nThe entire protocol selection system seems like technical debt now. This PR just deletes it all and treats AgentProtocol like any other headless extension: whichever protocols are registered by core or plugins are allowed. If a plugin developer wishes to conditionally roll out a protocol behind a feature flag, they can conditionally return null from getName. If an administrator has some weird reason to disable one protocol (but allow others) they could filter it out, but this is not something we would advertise as a supported controller customization.\nTesting done\nThe protocols section in Configure Security is gone.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nStop allowing configuration of the list of agent protocols.\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nThe list of agent protocols is no longer configurable, either through the GUI or JCasC. (Normally there will be two protocols, one for inbound TCP agents, and a ping protocol used to test connectivity.) The agentProtocols section of a JCasC bundle will now be ignored and should be deleted. If you do not wish to allow inbound TCP agents, disable the port rather than the protocol.\n\n  \n    \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

    "description": "Fixes #963.\nDescription\nThis pull request introduces a new GitlabCredentialResolver class to manage the retrieval of credentials for GitLab connections more centrally and securely within the Jenkins GitLab plugin. The previous logic for handling API tokens has been refactored out of GitLabConnection and related classes into this new resolver class, improving code readability and maintainability.\nKey changes include:\n\nCreation of the GitlabCredentialResolver class to handle credential resolution based on Item context and credential IDs.\nRefactoring GitLabClientBuilder and its implementations to accept a GitlabCredentialResolver instead of a plain API token string.\nModifying ApiHeaderTokenFilter to utilize GitlabCredentialResolver for injecting API tokens into HTTP requests.\nUpdates to unit tests to accommodate the new method of resolving credentials, ensuring compatibility with the new design.\nFix for AWS Secret Manager Issue: Addressed an issue where, if AWS Secret Manager is used with a rotation mechanism, the plugin encounters problems because the client is cached and always uses the token with which it was initially created. This change ensures that credentials are retrieved each time they are used, allowing the plugin to work correctly with rotated tokens.\n\nTesting done\n\nUnit Tests: Updated existing tests to use GitlabCredentialResolver, ensuring they pass with the refactored code. This includes modifying tests like AutodetectingGitLabClientTest and TestUtility.\nManual Testing: Verified the following scenarios manually:\n\nConnection to GitLab using both global API tokens and job-specific credentials.\nEnsured that the new GitlabCredentialResolver properly tracks credentials when associated with specific Jenkins items.\nVerified that API requests include the correct PRIVATE_TOKEN header for both global and job-specific tokens.\nTested the resolution of credentials in environments with AWS Secret Manager to confirm that rotated tokens are correctly retrieved and used.\n\n\nAutomated Test Execution: Ran all existing tests to ensure that there are no regressions introduced by this refactoring.\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

The previous logic for handling API tokens has been refactored out of GitLabConnection and related classes into this new resolver class, improving code readability and maintainability.\nKey changes include:\n\nCreation of the GitlabCredentialResolver class to handle credential resolution based on Item context and credential IDs.\nRefactoring GitLabClientBuilder and its implementations to accept a GitlabCredentialResolver instead of a plain API token string.\nModifying ApiHeaderTokenFilter to utilize GitlabCredentialResolver for injecting API tokens into HTTP requests.\nUpdates to unit tests to accommodate the new method of resolving credentials, ensuring compatibility with the new design.\n\nTesting done\n\nUnit Tests: Updated existing tests to use GitlabCredentialResolver, ensuring they pass with the refactored code. This includes modifying tests like AutodetectingGitLabClientTest and TestUtility.\nManual Testing: Verified the following scenarios manually:\n\nConnection to GitLab using both global API tokens and job-specific credentials.\nEnsured that the new GitlabCredentialResolver properly tracks credentials when associated with specific Jenkins items.\nVerified that API requests include the correct PRIVATE_TOKEN header for both global and job-specific tokens.\n\n\nAutomated Test Execution: Ran all existing tests to ensure that there are no regressions introduced by this refactoring.\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",
