This may result in accidentally increasing your test coverage percentage.

[Issue #3694](projectlombok/lombok#3694).\nFEATURE: Lombok generates javadoc for you for most of the methods it adds; with this release, javadoc is also added to generated constructors.

    "description": "Hi folks! What do you think about adding kotlin-reflect as a dependency?\nI have a custom plugin that needs jackson-module-kotlin, which in turn requires kotlin-reflect. Today I can build up this dependency tree below, but unfortunately I get a kotlin.jvm.KotlinReflectionNotSupportedError: Kotlin reflection implementation is not found at runtime. Make sure you have kotlin-reflect.jar in the classpath\n+ my plugin\n     + jackson2-api\n     + jackson-module-kotlin\n     + okhttp-api\n     + kotlin-reflect\n\nBy adding kotlin-reflect to okhttp-api, the exception goes away. The dependency tree now looks like:\n+ my plugin\n     + jackson2-api\n     + jackson-module-kotlin\n     + okhttp-api\n         + kotlin-reflect\n\nThis works great for me and I think is a practical solution, but I can also see how it may be better to split off a kotlin-api plugin instead. Happy to do that if it's preferred. For what it's worth, my only uses for kotlin involve okhttp and jackson.\nTesting done\nPublished my version and ran with it locally, proving the runtime exception no longer happens.\nExisting tests pass.\n\nSubmitter checklist\n\n Make sure you are opening from a topic/feature/bugfix branch (right side) and not your main branch!\n Ensure that the pull request title represents the desired changelog entry\n Please describe what you did\n Link to relevant issues in GitHub or Jira\n Link to relevant pull requests, esp. upstream and downstream changes\n Ensure you have provided tests - that demonstrates feature works or fixes the issue",

It's not suitable for cryptographic authentication.\nconst zlib = require('node:zlib');\nconst { Buffer } = require('node:buffer');\n\nlet crc = zlib.crc32('hello');  // 907060870\ncrc = zlib.crc32('world', crc);  // 4192936109\n\ncrc = zlib.crc32(Buffer.from('hello', 'utf16le'));  // 1427272415\ncrc = zlib.crc32(Buffer.from('world', 'utf16le'), crc);  // 4150509955\nContributed by Joyee Cheung in #​52692\ncli: allow running wasm in limited vmem with --disable-wasm-trap-handler\nBy default, Node.js enables trap-handler-based WebAssembly bound\nchecks. As a result, V8 does not need to insert inline bound checks\nint the code compiled from WebAssembly which may speedup WebAssembly\nexecution significantly, but this optimization requires allocating\na big virtual memory cage (currently 10GB). If the Node.js process\ndoes not have access to a large enough virtual memory address space\ndue to system configurations or hardware limitations, users won't\nbe able to run any WebAssembly that involves allocation in this\nvirtual memory cage and will see an out-of-memory error.\n$ ulimit -v 5000000\n$ node -p \"new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 10, maximum: 100 });\"\n[eval]:1\nnew WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 10, maximum: 100 });\n^\n\nRangeError: WebAssembly.Memory(): could not allocate memory\n    at [eval]:1:1\n    at runScriptInThisContext (node:internal/vm:209:10)\n    at node:internal/process/execution:118:14\n    at [eval]-wrapper:6:24\n    at runScript (node:internal/process/execution:101:62)\n    at evalScript (node:internal/process/execution:136:3)\n    at node:internal/main/eval_string:49:3\n\n--disable-wasm-trap-handler disables this optimization so that\nusers can at least run WebAssembly (with a less optimial performance)\nwhen the virtual memory address space available to their Node.js\nprocess is lower than what the V8 WebAssembly memory cage needs.\nContributed by Joyee Cheung in #​52766\nOther Notable Changes\n\n[12512c3d0e] -

This flag is useful when you want to debug the code from the beginning. Unlike --inspect-brk, which breaks on the first line, this flag waits for debugger to be connected and then runs the code as soon as a session is established.\nContributed by Kohei Ueno in #​52734\nzlib: expose zlib.crc32()\nThis release exposes the crc32() function from zlib to user-land.\nIt computes a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check checksum of data. If\nvalue is specified, it is used as the starting value of the checksum,\notherwise, 0 is used as the starting value.\nThe CRC algorithm is designed to compute checksums and to detect error\nin data transmission.

As a result, V8 does not need to insert inline bound checks\nint the code compiled from WebAssembly which may speedup WebAssembly\nexecution significantly, but this optimization requires allocating\na big virtual memory cage (currently 10GB).

    "description": "What does this PR do?\n\nAddresses issue #434\nDescription of the Change\n\nThis issue arose from calling two different classes: Computer and ComputerSet. Datadog directly calls on the executor methods in Computer.java for each computer, while Jenkins calls the ComputerSet.java methods which itself calls Computer.java for each computer.\nHowever, ComputerSet.java applies some restrictions on when to call the executor methods of Computer.java--the number of busy executors and the number of total executors only considers online computers, while the number of free executors only considers computers that are either online or connecting, and which is accepting tasks. As such, in order to mimic how Jenkins counts total, free, and busy executors, this PR adds the ComputerSet.java (and by extension, Jenkins) restrictions to the Datadog plugin's calls to Computer.java.\nAlternate Designs\n\nPossible Drawbacks\n\nVerification Process\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nRelease Notes\n\nReview checklist (to be filled by reviewers)\n\n Feature or bug fix MUST have appropriate tests (unit, integration, etc...)\n PR title must be written as a CHANGELOG entry (see why)\n Files changes must correspond to the primary purpose of the PR as described in the title (small unrelated changes should have their own PR)\n PR must have one changelog/ label attached.

This creates an unrealistic test environment.\nSolution\nEnable compression at the servlet container level in the test harness, matching production.\nDeployment plan\nThis change is not necessarily safe to backport, since on older cores it might result in double-compression. But it is safe to land on the default branch, since the jenkins.version is 2.463, which includes jenkinsci/jenkins#9379.\nTesting done\nWill run PCT.",

It is the result of\n11 months of development since the last feature release and is the work\nof 212 contributors spread over 1078 pull requests. It contains a large\nnumber of exciting new features as well as changes to both the Python\nand C APIs.\nThis major release includes breaking changes that could not happen in a\nregular minor (feature) release - including an ABI break, changes to\ntype promotion rules, and API changes which may not have been emitting\ndeprecation warnings in 1.26.x. Key documents related to how to adapt to\nchanges in NumPy 2.0, in addition to these release notes, include:\n\nThe numpy-2-migration-guide\nThe Numpy 2.0-specific advice in for dpwmstream package authors\n\nHighlights\nHighlights of this release include:\n\nNew features:\n\nA new variable-length string dtype, numpy.dtypes.StringDType and a new\nnumpy.strings namespace with performant ufuncs for string operations,\nSupport for float32 and longdouble in all\nnumpy.fft functions,\nSupport for the array API standard in the main numpy\nnamespace.\n\n\nPerformance improvements:\n\nSorting functions sort, argsort,\npartition, argpartition have been\naccelerated through the use of the Intel x86-simd-sort and\nGoogle Highway libraries, and may see large (hardware-specific)\nspeedups,\nmacOS Accelerate support and binary wheels for macOS \u003e=14, with\nsignificant performance improvements for linear algebra\noperations on macOS, and wheels that are about 3 times smaller,\nnumpy.char fixed-length string operations have\nbeen accelerated by implementing ufuncs that also support\nnumpy.dtypes.StringDType in addition to the\nfixed-length string dtypes,\nA new tracing and introspection API,\nnumpy.lib.introspect.opt_func_info, to determine\nwhich hardware-specific kernels are available and will be\ndispatched to.\nnumpy.save now uses pickle protocol version 4 for saving\narrays with object dtype, which allows for pickle objects larger\nthan 4GB and improves saving speed by about 5% for large arrays.\n\n\nPython API improvements:\n\n\n\n...
