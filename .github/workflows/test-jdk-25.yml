# This workflow runs test-jdk-25.sh with a 6-hour timeout and keep-alive output.
# It is triggered manually, on push to top-250-plugins.csv, and on a schedule.
# If the script makes changes, a PR is automatically created with the "automation" label for automerge.
# The auto-merge workflow in .github/workflows/auto-merge-bot-prs.yml will handle automerge for PRs created by github-actions[bot] with this label.
