This transition serves as an intermediary phase, ensuring that all systems are optimized for Java 11 before making the leap to Java 17.\nEnhancements and Security\nBy moving to this LTS version, we benefit from the latest performance and security improvements foundational to Java 11. Ensuring our dependencies are up-to-date and secure prepares the groundwork for a smoother transition to Java 17.\nLong-Term Support\nThe LTS version provides the necessary support and stability for Java 11, offering assurance during our gradual migration process. This allows us to take advantage of long-term updates and critical patches.\nEmbracing these incremental changes aligns our development environment with current standards and strategically positions us for future advancement. We appreciate your feedback and testing as we aim for a seamless adjustment period.",
